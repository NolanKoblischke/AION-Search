Overall Morphology  \n   \u2022 The dominant object is a single, nearly round, smooth\u2010light galaxy whose surface\u2013brightness profile is centrally peaked and lacks any obvious disc, bar, or spiral substructure.  The appearance is therefore most consistent with an early-type system (E0\u2013E1 or, less likely, a face-on S0).  \n   \u2022 No evidence of a major merger (e.g., large-scale tidal tails, double nuclei) is seen at the depth and resolution of this frame.\n\n2. Prominent Features & Characteristics  \n   a. Main (yellow) galaxy  \n      \u2013 Light distribution: Smooth, centrally concentrated with a monotonically declining halo; the isophotes are close to circular (axial ratio \u22730.9).  \n      \u2013 Colour: Red-to-yellow integrated colour suggests an old, metal-rich stellar population typical of quenched early-type galaxies.  \n      \u2013 Nucleus: A point-like core is present but not noticeably saturated; no obvious blue excess or jet-like features indicative of a strongly radiative AGN are detected.  \n      \u2013 Outer envelope: A very faint, diffuse glow extends \u22722\u20133\u00d7 the effective radius; no sharply defined shells, ripples, or tidal streams are discernible.  \n\n   b. Companion/foreground objects  \n      \u2013 Blue compact source (upper-left): Unresolved or marginally resolved, with a markedly bluer colour than the primary galaxy.  Given its point-spread function (PSF) shape and colour, it is most plausibly (i) a foreground Milky-Way star, or (ii) a background star-forming dwarf/compact galaxy.  No bridge or distortion links it to the central system, arguing against an ongoing interaction.  \n      \u2013 Fainter sources: One or two very small, low-S/N spots (e.g., just right of the galaxy) are visible; these could be background galaxies or globular-cluster\u2013scale satellites, but the data are insufficient for secure classification.  \n\n   c. Absent features  \n      \u2013 No well-defined spiral arms, dust lanes, bars, rings, or polar structures are detected.  \n      \u2013 No strong gravitational-lensing arcs or multiple images are present.  \n\n3.

Overall Morphology  \n   \u2022 The dominant object is a single, nearly round, smooth\u2010light galaxy whose surface\u2013brightness profile is centrally peaked and lacks any obvious disc, bar, or spiral substructure.  The appearance is therefore most consistent with an early-type system (E0\u2013E1 or, less likely, a face-on S0).  \n   \u2022 No evidence of a major merger (e.g., large-scale tidal tails, double nuclei) is seen at the depth and resolution of this frame.\n\n2. Prominent Features & Characteristics  \n   a. Main (yellow) galaxy  \n      \u2013 Light distribution: Smooth, centrally concentrated with a monotonically declining halo; the isophotes are close to circular (axial ratio \u22730.9).  \n      \u2013 Colour: Red-to-yellow integrated colour suggests an old, metal-rich stellar population typical of quenched early-type galaxies.  \n      \u2013 Nucleus: A point-like core is present but not noticeably saturated; no obvious blue excess or jet-like features indicative of a strongly radiative AGN are detected.  \n      \u2013 Outer envelope: A very faint, diffuse glow extends \u22722\u20133\u00d7 the effective radius; no sharply defined shells, ripples, or tidal streams are discernible.  \n\n   b. Companion/foreground objects  \n      \u2013 Blue compact source (upper-left): Unresolved or marginally resolved, with a markedly bluer colour than the primary galaxy.  Given its point-spread function (PSF) shape and colour, it is most plausibly (i) a foreground Milky-Way star, or (ii) a background star-forming dwarf/compact galaxy.  No bridge or distortion links it to the central system, arguing against an ongoing interaction.  \n      \u2013 Fainter sources: One or two very small, low-S/N spots (e.g., just right of the galaxy) are visible; these could be background galaxies or globular-cluster\u2013scale satellites, but the data are insufficient for secure classification.  \n\n   c. Absent features  \n      \u2013 No well-defined spiral arms, dust lanes, bars, rings, or polar structures are detected.  \n      \u2013 No strong gravitational-lensing arcs or multiple images are present.  \n\n3.

The absence of obvious flocculent structure rules out a face-on view; the lack of a box/peanut profile in the bulge somewhat favours a classic thin disk over a barred S0.\n\n2. Prominent Features & Characteristics  \na) Stellar Disk  \n\u2003\u2013 Morphology: A linear, needle-like structure extending symmetrically \u2248 20\u201325\u2033 across the frame.  \n\u2003\u2013 Surface-brightness profile: Exponential light fall-off along the major axis, with a full width at half maximum only a few pixels on the minor axis, indicative of a very thin disk.  \n\u2003\u2013 Colour: Slightly redder than a typical blue star-forming disk, suggesting moderate internal extinction and/or an evolved stellar population.  \n\u2003\u2013 Orientation: Position angle ~45\u00b0 measured N\u2192E. No noticeable warp or flare within the optical radius.  \n\nb) Central Bulge  \n\u2003\u2013 Appears as an oval luminosity enhancement occupying ~10\u201315% of the major-axis length.  \n\u2003\u2013 Colour: Yellow\u2013orange, consistent with an old, metal-rich stellar population.  \n\u2003\u2013 Shape: Smooth and featureless; no bar signature or X-/boxy isophotes detectable at this resolution.  \n\nc) Dust Content  \n\u2003\u2013 No sharply defined dust lane is apparent. Either the dust layer is intrinsically weak, the inclination is slightly off exact edge-on, or the optical depth is too low to imprint a dark lane against the stellar continuum.  \n\nd) Star-formation/AGN indicators  \n\u2003\u2013 The galaxy\u2019s optical colour is overall moderate-to-red, and there are no compact blue knots or nuclear point sources. Within the limits of broadband imaging, there is no obvious signature of vigorous star-forming complexes or an AGN. Spectroscopic follow-up would be required for confirmation.  \n\ne) Environment / Line-of-sight objects  \n\u2003\u2013 Several faint, red background galaxies and a few field stars are scattered in the FoV; none show interaction signatures with the primary galaxy.  \n\u2003\u2013 No tidal tails, shells, or bridges are visible, suggesting dynamical isolation at present.  \n\u2003\u2013 No arcs or multiple images indicative of strong gravitational lensing are present.  \n\n3. Additional Context & Interpretation  \n\u2022 The combination of a very thin stellar disk, modest bulge, and lack of strong dust absorption implies either (i) a late-type spiral with a comparatively quiescent interstellar medium, or (ii) an S0 galaxy that has exhausted or lost most of its cold gas.  \n\u2022 The galaxy\u2019s thinness and regularity argue against a recent major merger; any accretion event must have been minor and dynamically gentle.  \n\u2022 If classified as an S0, this system could represent the faded remnant of a spiral that quenched via environmental processes (e.g., ram-pressure stripping or strangulation) but retained its disk structure.  \n\u2022 Deep surface photometry or integral-field spectroscopy would help to (i) quantify the disk scale height and possible thick-disk component, (ii) detect low-level star formation, and (iii) measure stellar kinematics to distinguish between S0 and late-type spiral scenarios.", "input_tokens": 843, "output_tokens": 803, "decision_tree": [{"question": "smooth-or-featured", "answer": "featured-or-disk", "node": "smooth-or-featured_featured-or-disk", "votes": 10, "agreement": 0.909}, {"question": "disk-edge-on", "answer": "yes", "node": "disk-edge-on_yes", "votes": 10, "agreement": 1.0}, {"question": "edge-on-bulge", "answer": "rounded", "node": "edge-on-bulge_rounded", "votes": 10, "agreement": 1.0}, {"question": "merging", "answer": "none", "node": "merging_none", "votes": 10, "agreement": 1.0}], "iauname": "J025713.57+013450.1", "decision_tree_score": 1.0, "judge_results": {"judge_decision_tree": {"overall_shape": "featured-or-disk", "roundness": null, "edge_on": "edge-on-yes", "edge_on_bulge": "rounded", "has_spiral_arms": null, "spiral_winding": null, "spiral_arm_count": null, "bar": null, "bulge_size": null, "merging": "none"}, "judge_path": ["smooth-or-featured_featured-or-disk", "disk-edge-on_yes", "edge-on-bulge_rounded", "merging_none"], "volunteer_path": ["smooth-or-featured_featured-or-disk", "disk-edge-on_yes", "edge-on-bulge_rounded", "merging_none"], "judge_prompt": "You are an expert astronomer who will classify a galaxy by following the same decision tree structure used by citizen scientists in Galaxy Zoo.\n\nYou will be given a galaxy description and must make decisions following this exact decision tree structure:\n\n**STEP 1: Overall Shape (Required)**\n- smooth: Galaxy appears smooth and featureless with no obvious structure\n- featured-or-disk: Galaxy shows clear structure like spiral arms, bars, or disk features  \n- artifact: Image appears to be a star, artifact, or defect rather than a galaxy\n\n**STEP 2: Follow the appropriate branch based on Step 1**\n\n**If SMOOTH:**\n- Determine roundness: round, in-between, cigar-shaped, or not-mentioned\n\n**If FEATURED-OR-DISK:**\n- Determine if edge-on: edge-on-yes, edge-on-no, or not-mentioned\n\n**If edge-on-yes:**\n- Determine bulge shape: boxy, none, rounded, or not-mentioned\n\n**If edge-on-no:**\n- Determine if has spiral arms: has-spiral-arms-yes, has-spiral-arms-no, or not-mentioned\n- If has spiral arms:\n  - Determine spiral winding: tight, medium, loose, or not-mentioned\n  - Determine arm count: 1, 2, 3, 4, more-than-4, cant-tell, or not-mentioned\n- For all non-edge-on galaxies (regardless of spiral arms):\n  - Determine bar strength: strong, weak, no, or not-mentioned\n  - Determine bulge size: dominant, large, moderate, small, none, or not-mentioned\n\n**STEP 3: Merging Status (ONLY for smooth and featured-or-disk galaxies, NOT artifacts)**\n- none: No signs of disturbance or interaction\n- minor-disturbance: Small distortions or asymmetries\n- major-disturbance: Significant warping, tidal features, or distortions\n- merger: Clear signs of ongoing merger or recent collision\n- not-mentioned: The description does not mention anything about merging or disturbance\n\n**IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:**\n- Base your decisions ONLY on what you can observe in the description\n- **Use \"not-mentioned\" for any field where the description does not provide sufficient information to make a determination**\n- Follow the decision tree logic - only fill out fields that are relevant for your path\n- Be definitive in your choices when information is available\n- **Merging status is ONLY asked for smooth and featured-or-disk galaxies, NOT for artifacts**\n- If the description is unclear about a specific feature, choose \"not-mentioned\" rather than guessing\n\n**GALAXY DESCRIPTION:**\n1.

Prominent Features & Characteristics  \na) Stellar Disk  \n\u2003\u2013 Morphology: A linear, needle-like structure extending symmetrically \u2248 20\u201325\u2033 across the frame.  \n\u2003\u2013 Surface-brightness profile: Exponential light fall-off along the major axis, with a full width at half maximum only a few pixels on the minor axis, indicative of a very thin disk.  \n\u2003\u2013 Colour: Slightly redder than a typical blue star-forming disk, suggesting moderate internal extinction and/or an evolved stellar population.  \n\u2003\u2013 Orientation: Position angle ~45\u00b0 measured N\u2192E. No noticeable warp or flare within the optical radius.  \n\nb) Central Bulge  \n\u2003\u2013 Appears as an oval luminosity enhancement occupying ~10\u201315% of the major-axis length.  \n\u2003\u2013 Colour: Yellow\u2013orange, consistent with an old, metal-rich stellar population.  \n\u2003\u2013 Shape: Smooth and featureless; no bar signature or X-/boxy isophotes detectable at this resolution.  \n\nc) Dust Content  \n\u2003\u2013 No sharply defined dust lane is apparent. Either the dust layer is intrinsically weak, the inclination is slightly off exact edge-on, or the optical depth is too low to imprint a dark lane against the stellar continuum.  \n\nd) Star-formation/AGN indicators  \n\u2003\u2013 The galaxy\u2019s optical colour is overall moderate-to-red, and there are no compact blue knots or nuclear point sources. Within the limits of broadband imaging, there is no obvious signature of vigorous star-forming complexes or an AGN. Spectroscopic follow-up would be required for confirmation.  \n\ne) Environment / Line-of-sight objects  \n\u2003\u2013 Several faint, red background galaxies and a few field stars are scattered in the FoV; none show interaction signatures with the primary galaxy.  \n\u2003\u2013 No tidal tails, shells, or bridges are visible, suggesting dynamical isolation at present.  \n\u2003\u2013 No arcs or multiple images indicative of strong gravitational lensing are present.  \n\n3. Additional Context & Interpretation  \n\u2022 The combination of a very thin stellar disk, modest bulge, and lack of strong dust absorption implies either (i) a late-type spiral with a comparatively quiescent interstellar medium, or (ii) an S0 galaxy that has exhausted or lost most of its cold gas.  \n\u2022 The galaxy\u2019s thinness and regularity argue against a recent major merger; any accretion event must have been minor and dynamically gentle.  \n\u2022 If classified as an S0, this system could represent the faded remnant of a spiral that quenched via environmental processes (e.g., ram-pressure stripping or strangulation) but retained its disk structure.  \n\u2022 Deep surface photometry or integral-field spectroscopy would help to (i) quantify the disk scale height and possible thick-disk component, (ii) detect low-level star formation, and (iii) measure stellar kinematics to distinguish between S0 and late-type spiral scenarios.\n\nClassify this galaxy by following the decision tree structure above."}, "judge_model": "gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20", "judge_thinking_budget": 24000}

Overall Morphology  \nThe central object is a single, moderately-inclined disk galaxy.  Its light distribution is smooth in the innermost \u22722\u2033 and flattens into an elongated, exponentially-declining envelope.  No large-scale asymmetries or multiple nuclei are apparent.  The morphology is therefore best described as an early-type spiral or lenticular, i.e. S0/a\u2013Sa (unbarred).\n\n2. Prominent Features & Characteristics  \n\n\u2022 Stellar disk  \n  \u2013 Isophotes are elliptical (axis ratio b/a \u2248 0.6) with a position angle \u2248 40\u00b0 east of north.  \n  \u2013 Radial extent of the visible disk is \u2248 4\u20135\u2033 (\u223c8\u201310\u2033 diameter), beyond which the surface brightness falls below the sky noise.  \n  \u2013 Very faint, broad two-armed structure is tentatively visible, but at the given resolution it is not possible to trace well-defined spiral arms.  \n\n\u2022 Bulge  \n  \u2013 Central light concentration is rounder (b/a \u2248 0.9) and FWHM only slightly larger than the stellar PSF, indicating a classical bulge of small effective radius (re \u2272 1\u2033).  \n  \u2013 No unresolved nuclear point source is detected; hence no obvious optical AGN signature.  \n\n\u2022 Bar / lenses / rings  \n  \u2013 No photometric bar, lens, or ring structure is discernible within the seeing limit.  \n\n\u2022 Dust and star-forming regions  \n  \u2013 The disk appears smooth with no prominent dust lanes or knotty H II complexes.  Any dust or SF activity must therefore be either weak or unresolved.  \n\n\u2022 Companion / tidal structure  \n  \u2013 A small, low-surface-brightness patch just south-south-west of the disk could be a dwarf companion or a tidal clump, but the signal is marginal and needs deeper imaging for confirmation.  No large-scale tidal tails, shells, or distorted isophotes are detected.  \n\n\u2022 Foreground & background sources  \n  \u2013 Several point sources with stellar PSFs are present: a red star \u2248 5\u2033 west of the galaxy, a blue star \u2248 6\u2033 south-east, and a fainter background source \u2248 4\u2033 north.  None show morphological extension or lensing distortions.\n\n3.

Overall Morphology  \nThe central object is a single, moderately-inclined disk galaxy.  Its light distribution is smooth in the innermost \u22722\u2033 and flattens into an elongated, exponentially-declining envelope.  No large-scale asymmetries or multiple nuclei are apparent.  The morphology is therefore best described as an early-type spiral or lenticular, i.e. S0/a\u2013Sa (unbarred).\n\n2. Prominent Features & Characteristics  \n\n\u2022 Stellar disk  \n  \u2013 Isophotes are elliptical (axis ratio b/a \u2248 0.6) with a position angle \u2248 40\u00b0 east of north.  \n  \u2013 Radial extent of the visible disk is \u2248 4\u20135\u2033 (\u223c8\u201310\u2033 diameter), beyond which the surface brightness falls below the sky noise.  \n  \u2013 Very faint, broad two-armed structure is tentatively visible, but at the given resolution it is not possible to trace well-defined spiral arms.  \n\n\u2022 Bulge  \n  \u2013 Central light concentration is rounder (b/a \u2248 0.9) and FWHM only slightly larger than the stellar PSF, indicating a classical bulge of small effective radius (re \u2272 1\u2033).  \n  \u2013 No unresolved nuclear point source is detected; hence no obvious optical AGN signature.  \n\n\u2022 Bar / lenses / rings  \n  \u2013 No photometric bar, lens, or ring structure is discernible within the seeing limit.  \n\n\u2022 Dust and star-forming regions  \n  \u2013 The disk appears smooth with no prominent dust lanes or knotty H II complexes.  Any dust or SF activity must therefore be either weak or unresolved.  \n\n\u2022 Companion / tidal structure  \n  \u2013 A small, low-surface-brightness patch just south-south-west of the disk could be a dwarf companion or a tidal clump, but the signal is marginal and needs deeper imaging for confirmation.  No large-scale tidal tails, shells, or distorted isophotes are detected.  \n\n\u2022 Foreground & background sources  \n  \u2013 Several point sources with stellar PSFs are present: a red star \u2248 5\u2033 west of the galaxy, a blue star \u2248 6\u2033 south-east, and a fainter background source \u2248 4\u2033 north.  None show morphological extension or lensing distortions.\n\n3. Additional Context & Interpretation  \n\n\u2022 The overall colour (integrated g\u2013r \u2243 0.45 \u00b1 0.05 from SDSS-like rendering) places the system in the \u201cgreen valley\u201d between the blue cloud of actively star-forming spirals and the red sequence of passive S0s.  \n\n\u2022 With an angular diameter of ~10\u2033, the physical diameter would be \u2248 4 kpc at z \u2248 0.02 (assuming H\u2080 = 70 km s\u207b\u00b9 Mpc\u207b\u00b9).

Additional Context & Interpretation  \nThe morphology is consistent with an intermediate-to-late stage major merger in which the stellar envelopes are already coalescing while at least one progenitor disc remains partly intact. The bright, south-pointing plume could be a tidal tail projected nearly along the line of sight, giving it a narrower appearance. The colour homogeneity of the central light suggests that star formation has largely shut down, possibly quenched by gas exhaustion or feedback following the merger-induced starburst phase. The system does not show the blue, clumpy morphology typical of high-specific-SFR mergers, implying either an advanced age for the interaction or a relatively gas-poor encounter (e.g., S0 + S0/elliptical).

Prominent Features & Characteristics  \n\u2022 Disturbed main body  \n  \u2013 Surface\u2013brightness profile: centrally concentrated, rising steeply to a compact nucleus with a diffuse, plume-like extension toward the south.  \n  \u2013 Shape: broad, almost triangular envelope whose apex points southward, implying either a tidal tail or an infalling companion that has lost angular momentum.  \n  \u2013 Colour: uniformly yellow-orange in the gri composite, indicating an evolved stellar population with little current star formation; no obvious blue clumps that would trace H II regions.  \n\n\u2022 Edge-on companion (SE)  \n  \u2013 Morphology: thin, lenticular/spiral disc seen nearly edge-on, axial ratio \u22734:1.  \n  \u2013 Orientation: major axis oriented roughly NE\u2013SW, mis-aligned with the radial vector to the primary, consistent with an un\u2013relaxed orbit rather than a simple projection of an internal disc.  \n  \u2013 Colour: slightly bluer than the main body, hinting at residual star formation or a younger stellar age.  \n\n\u2022 Minor condensations  \n  \u2013 Several fainter knots NW and due south of the main pair, likely dwarf satellites, tidal debris condensations, or unrelated background objects.  \n  \u2013 The brightest of these (just SW of the primary) is unresolved at this resolution and could be a compact star-forming clump liberated during the interaction.  \n\n\u2022 Absence of obvious structures  \n  \u2013 No coherent spiral arm pattern, bar, or dust lane can be traced in the primary; any pre-existing disc appears to have been disrupted.  \n  \u2013 No discernible point-like AGN signature (e.g., saturated nuclear pixel or pronounced blue core).  \n  \u2013 No strongly lensed arcs or counter\u2013images; gravitational lensing is unlikely to be significant here.\n\n3. Additional Context & Interpretation  \nThe morphology is consistent with an intermediate-to-late stage major merger in which the stellar envelopes are already coalescing while at least one progenitor disc remains partly intact. The bright, south-pointing plume could be a tidal tail projected nearly along the line of sight, giving it a narrower appearance. The colour homogeneity of the central light suggests that star formation has largely shut down, possibly quenched by gas exhaustion or feedback following the merger-induced starburst phase. The system does not show the blue, clumpy morphology typical of high-specific-SFR mergers, implying either an advanced age for the interaction or a relatively gas-poor encounter (e.g., S0 + S0/elliptical). Spectroscopic follow-up would clarify the dynamical state, reveal any low-luminosity AGN activity, and quantify stellar-population ages across the plume and companion.\n\nClassify this galaxy by following the decision tree structure above."}, "judge_model": "gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20", "judge_thinking_budget": 24000}

Overall Morphology  \n\u2022 The brightest object in the field is a smooth, centrally\u2013concentrated, yellow system consistent with an early-type (E/S0) galaxy.  \n\u2022 A second, nearly co-axial luminous knot located \u22481.5\u20132.0\u2033 to the south of the main core and embedded in the same low-surface-brightness envelope indicates that the system is very likely an interacting/merging pair rather than an isolated single galaxy.  \n\u2022 No large-scale, high-contrast spiral structure is detected; the aggregate morphology is therefore best classified as an early-type minor/major merger in progress.\n\n2.

Central luminous core  \n   \u2013 Bright, \u223c0.8\u20131.0\u2033 FWHM, yellow in (g-r-i) composite, implying an old, metal-rich stellar population.  \n   \u2013 Light profile appears smooth with no obvious point-source excess, arguing against a dominant unobscured AGN at the current spatial resolution.  \n\nb. Secondary southern nucleus / companion  \n   \u2013 Roughly one magnitude fainter than the primary, showing comparable colour, suggesting it is not a background projection but a physically associated companion.  \n   \u2013 Embedded in the same diffuse halo; a very low-contrast bridge of emission is discernible between the two nuclei, strengthening the merger interpretation.  \n\nc. Diffuse stellar envelope / tidal debris  \n   \u2013 The envelope extends \u22733\u20134\u2033 from the geometric centre, slightly elongated along the north-south axis.  \n   \u2013 Surface-brightness asymmetries are present: the southern side is marginally brighter, consistent with tidal overlap of the two stellar systems.  \n\nd. Compact blue knots  \n   \u2013 A small, unresolved blue source \u22481.5\u2033 north-west of the primary nucleus and another fainter bluish point \u22480.8\u2033 south-west could be:  \n     \u2022 star-forming clumps triggered by the interaction, or  \n     \u2022 unrelated foreground stars/background dwarf galaxies.  \n   \u2013 Their point-like morphology and colour make foreground Galactic stars a plausible alternative, but spectroscopy or proper-motion data would be required for confirmation.  \n\ne.

Overall Morphology  \n   \u2022 The dominant object is a single, highly\u2010inclined disk galaxy (edge-on orientation).  \n   \u2022 The light distribution shows a moderately luminous central bulge embedded in a narrow, elongated stellar disk.  \n   \u2022 The system is not completely symmetric: low-surface-brightness substructures are present on both sides of the mid-plane, suggestive of a minor interaction or weak tidal distortion rather than a fully relaxed S0.\n\n2. Prominent Features & Characteristics  \n   a. Bulge  \n      \u2013 Bright, compact, and centrally concentrated; FWHM only marginally larger than the PSF, implying a classical bulge rather than a pseudo-bulge.  \n      \u2013 Colour appears slightly redder than the outer disk, consistent with an older stellar population or modest internal extinction.  \n\n   b. Stellar Disk  \n      \u2013 Thin and linear, spanning the full major axis with an axial ratio b/a \u2272 0.15.  \n      \u2013 Surface-brightness profile declines smoothly with no obvious breaks; no clear bar signature is detectable at this resolution.  \n      \u2013 A subtle warp is visible: the north-eastern end (upper right) is tilted slightly above the mid-plane relative to the south-western end (lower left).  \n\n   c. Dust and ISM Tracers  \n      \u2013 No centrally obscuring dust lane is seen, suggesting either a relatively dust-poor disk or that the galaxy is inclined, but not exactly edge-on (i \u2248 80\u201385\u00b0).  \n      \u2013 A diffuse bluish sheen beneath the mid-plane (south-western side) could be scattered light from a low column density of dust or extraplanar star-forming gas.  \n\n   d. Satellite / Tidal Features  \n      \u2013 Two compact, blue knots are detected just below and trailing the south-western tip of the disk; a third, slightly larger diffuse knot lies ~3\u20134\u2033 above the same tip.  \n      \u2013 Their colours and morphology are consistent with dwarf companions or star-forming clumps entrained in a tidal stream.  \n      \u2013 The spatial alignment of these knots with the extraplanar warp suggests an ongoing minor merger or accretion event.  \n\n   e.

Overall Morphology  \n   \u2022 The dominant object is a single, highly\u2010inclined disk galaxy (edge-on orientation).  \n   \u2022 The light distribution shows a moderately luminous central bulge embedded in a narrow, elongated stellar disk.  \n   \u2022 The system is not completely symmetric: low-surface-brightness substructures are present on both sides of the mid-plane, suggestive of a minor interaction or weak tidal distortion rather than a fully relaxed S0.\n\n2. Prominent Features & Characteristics  \n   a. Bulge  \n      \u2013 Bright, compact, and centrally concentrated; FWHM only marginally larger than the PSF, implying a classical bulge rather than a pseudo-bulge.  \n      \u2013 Colour appears slightly redder than the outer disk, consistent with an older stellar population or modest internal extinction.  \n\n   b. Stellar Disk  \n      \u2013 Thin and linear, spanning the full major axis with an axial ratio b/a \u2272 0.15.  \n      \u2013 Surface-brightness profile declines smoothly with no obvious breaks; no clear bar signature is detectable at this resolution.  \n      \u2013 A subtle warp is visible: the north-eastern end (upper right) is tilted slightly above the mid-plane relative to the south-western end (lower left).  \n\n   c. Dust and ISM Tracers  \n      \u2013 No centrally obscuring dust lane is seen, suggesting either a relatively dust-poor disk or that the galaxy is inclined, but not exactly edge-on (i \u2248 80\u201385\u00b0).  \n      \u2013 A diffuse bluish sheen beneath the mid-plane (south-western side) could be scattered light from a low column density of dust or extraplanar star-forming gas.  \n\n   d. Satellite / Tidal Features  \n      \u2013 Two compact, blue knots are detected just below and trailing the south-western tip of the disk; a third, slightly larger diffuse knot lies ~3\u20134\u2033 above the same tip.  \n      \u2013 Their colours and morphology are consistent with dwarf companions or star-forming clumps entrained in a tidal stream.  \n      \u2013 The spatial alignment of these knots with the extraplanar warp suggests an ongoing minor merger or accretion event.  \n\n   e. Foreground or Background Objects  \n      \u2013 Several unresolved red point sources are scattered across the field; their colours and PSF profiles match Galactic foreground stars or background passive galaxies and are unlikely to be physically associated with the main system.  \n      \u2013 No multiply imaged background source or arc\u2010like morphology indicative of strong lensing is present.  \n\n3.

Bulge/central luminosity enhancement  \n   \u2013 The inner \u22482\u20133\u2033 (image centre) exhibits a smooth, slightly redder core relative to the surrounding disk, indicative of an old-stellar bulge component.  \nb. Stellar disk  \n   \u2013 Extends symmetrically \u22484\u20135\u2033 from the bulge on both sides.  \n   \u2013 The disk is extremely thin; the minor-to-major axis ratio is \u22720.15, implying an inclination i \u2273 85\u00b0.  \n   \u2013 Outer disk light is noticeably bluer than the bulge, consistent with a younger stellar population and/or lower internal extinction toward the disk periphery.  \nc. Dust lane  \n   \u2013 A narrow, slightly darker band is marginally visible running along the projected mid-plane, most apparent just outside the bulge; this is interpreted as an edge-on dust lane obscuring the far side of the inner disk.  \nd. Absence of large-scale perturbations  \n   \u2013 No obvious tidal tails, asymmetries, warps, or shells are detected at the image depth, arguing against an ongoing major merger.  \ne. Environment/foreground\u2013background objects  \n   \u2013 No foreground stars bright enough to contaminate the galaxy photometry are present within a few arcseconds.  \n   \u2013 A few faint, unresolved background sources are visible but do not interact with the main galaxy.\n\n3. Additional Context & Interpretation  \n\u2022 The colour gradient (red bulge, bluer disk) is typical for late-type spirals where the bulge is dominated by older, metal-rich populations and the disk hosts more recent star formation.  \n\u2022 The weak dust lane and lack of high-contrast knots suggest moderate, but not extreme, star-formation rates; if spectroscopic data were available, one would expect H\u03b1 equivalent widths characteristic of quiescent to mildly active disks.  \n\u2022 The absence of morphological disturbances or companions within the field implies the galaxy is currently in a secular evolutionary phase.

Prominent Features & Characteristics  \na. Bulge/central luminosity enhancement  \n   \u2013 The inner \u22482\u20133\u2033 (image centre) exhibits a smooth, slightly redder core relative to the surrounding disk, indicative of an old-stellar bulge component.  \nb. Stellar disk  \n   \u2013 Extends symmetrically \u22484\u20135\u2033 from the bulge on both sides.  \n   \u2013 The disk is extremely thin; the minor-to-major axis ratio is \u22720.15, implying an inclination i \u2273 85\u00b0.  \n   \u2013 Outer disk light is noticeably bluer than the bulge, consistent with a younger stellar population and/or lower internal extinction toward the disk periphery.  \nc. Dust lane  \n   \u2013 A narrow, slightly darker band is marginally visible running along the projected mid-plane, most apparent just outside the bulge; this is interpreted as an edge-on dust lane obscuring the far side of the inner disk.  \nd. Absence of large-scale perturbations  \n   \u2013 No obvious tidal tails, asymmetries, warps, or shells are detected at the image depth, arguing against an ongoing major merger.  \ne. Environment/foreground\u2013background objects  \n   \u2013 No foreground stars bright enough to contaminate the galaxy photometry are present within a few arcseconds.  \n   \u2013 A few faint, unresolved background sources are visible but do not interact with the main galaxy.\n\n3. Additional Context & Interpretation  \n\u2022 The colour gradient (red bulge, bluer disk) is typical for late-type spirals where the bulge is dominated by older, metal-rich populations and the disk hosts more recent star formation.  \n\u2022 The weak dust lane and lack of high-contrast knots suggest moderate, but not extreme, star-formation rates; if spectroscopic data were available, one would expect H\u03b1 equivalent widths characteristic of quiescent to mildly active disks.  \n\u2022 The absence of morphological disturbances or companions within the field implies the galaxy is currently in a secular evolutionary phase. A low-level warp cannot be excluded without deeper imaging, but none is obvious here.  \n\u2022 Given the sharpness of the disk light profile, the system could serve as a useful target for studies of vertical disk structure (e.g., scale-height measurements) or for constraining dust content through radiative\u2013transfer modelling in edge-on spirals.\n\nClassify this galaxy by following the decision tree structure above."}, "judge_model": "gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20", "judge_thinking_budget": 24000}

Prominent Features & Characteristics  \na) Spiral arms  \n\u2003\u2022 Geometry: two primary arms, with secondary spurs, originating close to the bulge and maintaining coherence to the outer disc.  \n\u2003\u2022 Colour: globally blue\u2013cyan, consistent with OB-star dominated populations and active star formation.  \n\u2003\u2022 Pitch angle: \u223c15\u201320\u00b0 (visual estimate).  \n\nb) Point-like sources projected on the disc  \n\u2003\u2022 Bright green-yellow source in the eastern arm: diffraction-limited, \u223c0.5\u20131 arcsec FWHM, colours suggesting contamination in the r and i bands; likely a foreground Milky Way star rather than an H II complex (its PSF is markedly stellar and its colour is unusually green for an H II region in these filters).  \n\u2003\u2022 Bright cyan source in the south-western arm: similar PSF characteristics; likely another foreground star.  \n\u2003\u2022 Several fainter red/orange point sources distributed across the frame are also consistent with foreground stars.  \n\nc) Disc & inter-arm regions  \n\u2003\u2022 Surface brightness declines smoothly with radius; no obvious breaks or truncations.  \n\u2003\u2022 No prominent dust lanes are resolved, though the slight mottling within the inner arms hints at patchy extinction on sub-seeing scales.  \n\nd) Nuclear region  \n\u2003\u2022 No distinct, unresolved central point source above the bulge light; no obvious optical AGN signature at this resolution.  \n\u2003\u2022 The nuclear colour is only mildly redder than the bulge, arguing against significant dust-obscured starburst activity.  \n\ne) Environment / external structures  \n\u2003\u2022 No tidal tails, shells, or asymmetries indicative of an ongoing major merger.  \n\u2003\u2022 No secondary galaxies or background lensed features visible within the immediate field.  \n\n3. Additional Context & Interpretation  \n\u2022 Star-formation activity is concentrated along the spiral arms, as implied by their blue colour; an SFR on the order of a few M\u2299 yr\u207b\u00b9 would be typical for an Sc galaxy with this morphology.  \n\u2022 The well-defined arms and lack of strong bar suggest density-wave\u2013driven star formation rather than bar-induced inflows.  \n\u2022 Foreground stellar contamination must be accounted for in photometric or kinematic studies; the two brightest projected stars could bias integrated colours or create spurious H II\u2013region identifications if not masked.  \n\u2022 Absence of tidal distortions implies the galaxy is presently in a relatively isolated environment or interacting only weakly.  \n\u2022 Follow-up: higher-resolution, multi-band (including H\u03b1 and NIR) imaging would refine the bar classification, quantify dust content, and isolate true in-situ H II regions from projected foreground stars.\n\nClassify this galaxy by following the decision tree structure above."}, "judge_model": "gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20", "judge_thinking_budget": 24000}

No well-defined spiral structure or large-scale bar is visible; instead the light distribution is amorphous, consistent with the coalescence phase of a major (\u201c1:1\u201d or \u201c2:1\u201d) merger.\n\n2. Prominent Features & Characteristics  \n\n\u2022 Double nucleus  \n  \u2013 Two luminous, nearly point-like cores are resolved, separated by \u22481\u20132 arcsec along an E\u2013W axis (projected).  \n  \u2013 Both show comparable optical colours (yellow\u2013white), implying similar stellar populations or dust reddening; neither dominates dramatically over the other, supporting a mass ratio close to unity.  \n  \u2013 The separation and comparable brightness are typical of systems \u2272\u2009a few \u00d710\u2078 yr before final nuclear coalescence.  \n\n\u2022 Diffuse common envelope / tidal debris  \n  \u2013 Surrounds both nuclei and extends ~2\u20133 nuclear separations in radius.  \n  \u2013 Surface-brightness profile is smooth with a mild blue excess relative to the nuclei, suggestive of recent star formation triggered by the interaction.  \n  \u2013 The envelope is slightly elongated along the nucleus\u2013nucleus axis, hinting at tidal stretching; no sharply defined tidal tails are visible at this depth, implying either low surface brightness features below the noise or a viewing angle that foreshortens them.  \n\n\u2022 Absence of coherent disk features  \n  \u2013 No spiral arms, bars, or dust lanes are detectable at the current S/N and resolution. Any pre-merger disk structure has likely been disrupted.  \n\n\u2022 Possible foreground/background objects  \n  \u2013 A single orange, unresolved source ~4\u20135 arcsec south of the merger remnant is probably a foreground star (point-spread function matches stellar profile, colour inconsistent with the blue halo).  \n  \u2013 Several very faint, unresolved blue/white spots farther out are consistent with background galaxies or noise peaks; none show clear lensing distortion or interaction signatures with the main system.  \n\n\u2022 No obvious strong-lensing morphology  \n  \u2013 The symmetric, double-source appearance could superficially resemble a quad lens seen edge-on, but the continuous, common envelope and lack of multiple mirrored images argue against a gravitational lens interpretation.\n\n3. Additional Context & Interpretation  \n\n\u2022 Dynamical state  \n  The morphology (double nucleus plus smooth outer light) places the system near the \u201cnuclear pairing\u201d stage of a major merger. N-body/hydro simulations predict intense central starbursts and potentially dual AGN activity during this phase. The observed colour contrast (yellowish nuclei, bluer halo) is consistent with older bulge populations surrounded by younger, interaction-induced star-forming regions.  \n\n\u2022 Future evolution  \n  In another few \u00d710\u2078 yr dynamical friction will draw the two nuclei together, forming a single remnant. Stellar violent relaxation will erase most sub-structure, likely producing a field elliptical (or S0 if residual disk material survives). If the progenitors host super-massive black holes, a dual AGN could eventually merge, radiating low-frequency gravitational waves.  \n\n\u2022 Observational follow-ups  \n  \u2013 Deep, high-surface-brightness imaging (e.g., with HST or JWST) would test for low-contrast tidal tails or shells.  \n  \u2013 Integral-field spectroscopy could measure relative line-of-sight velocities, confirm dual AGN signatures, and map star-formation rates within the blue envelope.  \n  \u2013 Mid-IR or radio observations would constrain dust-obscured starburst activity and AGN obscuration.", "input_tokens": 843, "output_tokens": 957, "decision_tree": [{"question": "smooth-or-featured", "answer": "smooth", "node": "smooth-or-featured_smooth", "votes": 28, "agreement": 0.737}, {"question": "how-rounded", "answer": "in-between", "node": "how-rounded_in-between", "votes": 24, "agreement": 0.857}, {"question": "merging", "answer": "merger", "node": "merging_merger", "votes": 31, "agreement": 0.886}], "iauname": "J091754.53+072634.0", "decision_tree_score": 0.3333333333333333, "judge_results": {"judge_decision_tree": {"overall_shape": "featured-or-disk", "roundness": null, "edge_on": "edge-on-no", "edge_on_bulge": null, "has_spiral_arms": "has-spiral-arms-no", "spiral_winding": null, "spiral_arm_count": null, "bar": "no", "bulge_size": "not-mentioned", "merging": "merger"}, "judge_path": ["smooth-or-featured_featured-or-disk", "disk-edge-on_no", "has-spiral-arms_no", "bar_no", "bulge-size-not-mentioned", "merging_merger"], "volunteer_path": ["smooth-or-featured_smooth", "how-rounded_in-between", "merging_merger"], "judge_prompt": "You are an expert astronomer who will classify a galaxy by following the same decision tree structure used by citizen scientists in Galaxy Zoo.\n\nYou will be given a galaxy description and must make decisions following this exact decision tree structure:\n\n**STEP 1: Overall Shape (Required)**\n- smooth: Galaxy appears smooth and featureless with no obvious structure\n- featured-or-disk: Galaxy shows clear structure like spiral arms, bars, or disk features  \n- artifact: Image appears to be a star, artifact, or defect rather than a galaxy\n\n**STEP 2: Follow the appropriate branch based on Step 1**\n\n**If SMOOTH:**\n- Determine roundness: round, in-between, cigar-shaped, or not-mentioned\n\n**If FEATURED-OR-DISK:**\n- Determine if edge-on: edge-on-yes, edge-on-no, or not-mentioned\n\n**If edge-on-yes:**\n- Determine bulge shape: boxy, none, rounded, or not-mentioned\n\n**If edge-on-no:**\n- Determine if has spiral arms: has-spiral-arms-yes, has-spiral-arms-no, or not-mentioned\n- If has spiral arms:\n  - Determine spiral winding: tight, medium, loose, or not-mentioned\n  - Determine arm count: 1, 2, 3, 4, more-than-4, cant-tell, or not-mentioned\n- For all non-edge-on galaxies (regardless of spiral arms):\n  - Determine bar strength: strong, weak, no, or not-mentioned\n  - Determine bulge size: dominant, large, moderate, small, none, or not-mentioned\n\n**STEP 3: Merging Status (ONLY for smooth and featured-or-disk galaxies, NOT artifacts)**\n- none: No signs of disturbance or interaction\n- minor-disturbance: Small distortions or asymmetries\n- major-disturbance: Significant warping, tidal features, or distortions\n- merger: Clear signs of ongoing merger or recent collision\n- not-mentioned: The description does not mention anything about merging or disturbance\n\n**IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:**\n- Base your decisions ONLY on what you can observe in the description\n- **Use \"not-mentioned\" for any field where the description does not provide sufficient information to make a determination**\n- Follow the decision tree logic - only fill out fields that are relevant for your path\n- Be definitive in your choices when information is available\n- **Merging status is ONLY asked for smooth and featured-or-disk galaxies, NOT for artifacts**\n- If the description is unclear about a specific feature, choose \"not-mentioned\" rather than guessing\n\n**GALAXY DESCRIPTION:**\n1.

Prominent Features & Characteristics  \n\n\u2022 Double nucleus  \n  \u2013 Two luminous, nearly point-like cores are resolved, separated by \u22481\u20132 arcsec along an E\u2013W axis (projected).  \n  \u2013 Both show comparable optical colours (yellow\u2013white), implying similar stellar populations or dust reddening; neither dominates dramatically over the other, supporting a mass ratio close to unity.  \n  \u2013 The separation and comparable brightness are typical of systems \u2272\u2009a few \u00d710\u2078 yr before final nuclear coalescence.  \n\n\u2022 Diffuse common envelope / tidal debris  \n  \u2013 Surrounds both nuclei and extends ~2\u20133 nuclear separations in radius.  \n  \u2013 Surface-brightness profile is smooth with a mild blue excess relative to the nuclei, suggestive of recent star formation triggered by the interaction.  \n  \u2013 The envelope is slightly elongated along the nucleus\u2013nucleus axis, hinting at tidal stretching; no sharply defined tidal tails are visible at this depth, implying either low surface brightness features below the noise or a viewing angle that foreshortens them.  \n\n\u2022 Absence of coherent disk features  \n  \u2013 No spiral arms, bars, or dust lanes are detectable at the current S/N and resolution. Any pre-merger disk structure has likely been disrupted.  \n\n\u2022 Possible foreground/background objects  \n  \u2013 A single orange, unresolved source ~4\u20135 arcsec south of the merger remnant is probably a foreground star (point-spread function matches stellar profile, colour inconsistent with the blue halo).  \n  \u2013 Several very faint, unresolved blue/white spots farther out are consistent with background galaxies or noise peaks; none show clear lensing distortion or interaction signatures with the main system.  \n\n\u2022 No obvious strong-lensing morphology  \n  \u2013 The symmetric, double-source appearance could superficially resemble a quad lens seen edge-on, but the continuous, common envelope and lack of multiple mirrored images argue against a gravitational lens interpretation.\n\n3. Additional Context & Interpretation  \n\n\u2022 Dynamical state  \n  The morphology (double nucleus plus smooth outer light) places the system near the \u201cnuclear pairing\u201d stage of a major merger. N-body/hydro simulations predict intense central starbursts and potentially dual AGN activity during this phase. The observed colour contrast (yellowish nuclei, bluer halo) is consistent with older bulge populations surrounded by younger, interaction-induced star-forming regions.  \n\n\u2022 Future evolution  \n  In another few \u00d710\u2078 yr dynamical friction will draw the two nuclei together, forming a single remnant. Stellar violent relaxation will erase most sub-structure, likely producing a field elliptical (or S0 if residual disk material survives). If the progenitors host super-massive black holes, a dual AGN could eventually merge, radiating low-frequency gravitational waves.  \n\n\u2022 Observational follow-ups  \n  \u2013 Deep, high-surface-brightness imaging (e.g., with HST or JWST) would test for low-contrast tidal tails or shells.  \n  \u2013 Integral-field spectroscopy could measure relative line-of-sight velocities, confirm dual AGN signatures, and map star-formation rates within the blue envelope.  \n  \u2013 Mid-IR or radio observations would constrain dust-obscured starburst activity and AGN obscuration.\n\nClassify this galaxy by following the decision tree structure above."}, "judge_model": "gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20", "judge_thinking_budget": 24000}

Additional Context & Interpretation  \n\u2022 The greenish integrated colour places this object in the regime of star-forming late-type galaxies; the apparent lack of a dust lane could signal lower metallicity or a moderate star-formation rate spread vertically through the disk.  \n\u2022 If the red sources eastward are at similar redshift, the system could represent a nascent group environment, but the current data do not reveal morphological disturbance.  \n\u2022 Follow-up spectroscopy or deeper multi-band imaging would clarify:  \n\u2003\u2013 the presence/strength of any H\u03b1 emission or nebular lines (confirming current star formation)  \n\u2003\u2013 the line-of-sight kinematics to probe disk rotation and search for subtle warps or extraplanar gas  \n\u2003\u2013 the redshift of the eastern companions to assess potential environmental influence.\n\nClassify this galaxy by following the decision tree structure above."}, "judge_model": "gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20", "judge_thinking_budget": 24000}

Prominent Features & Characteristics  \n\u2022 Nuclei  \n  \u2013 Bright, compact nucleus in the northern/eastern (upper-right) galaxy; unresolved at this resolution and more centrally concentrated than its companion, suggestive of a dominant bulge or possible low-luminosity AGN.  \n  \u2013 A second, slightly dimmer nucleus resides in the southern/western (lower-left) galaxy. It is more extended, with a softer surface-brightness profile, indicating enhanced star formation or a less developed bulge.  \n\u2022 Tidal Bridge  \n  \u2013 A luminous, ~5\u20136 kpc-long bridge connects the two nuclei, visible as a faint, continuous swath of stellar light. The bridge curves slightly toward the trailing side of the secondary galaxy, typical of tidal stripping during first/second pericentric passage.  \n\u2022 Diffuse Tidal Envelope / Halo  \n  \u2013 A low-surface-brightness stellar envelope surrounds the primary (yellow) galaxy and blends into the bridge, giving the system a common photometric halo. The envelope is mildly asymmetric, elongated along the merger axis.  \n\u2022 Color Gradient & Star-forming Knots  \n  \u2013 The secondary galaxy exhibits a noticeably bluer integrated color than the primary, consistent with a higher specific SFR. Within its disk remnant, multiple small knots (too poorly resolved for individual photometry) are visible; their blue hues point to recent or ongoing stellar birth triggered by the interaction.  \n\u2022 Foreground / Background Point Sources  \n  \u2013 Several point-like objects (orange and whitish) lie in the field; the most conspicuous sits just SE of the primary halo. They are consistent with Milky Way stars or compact background galaxies and do not appear dynamically connected to the merger. No strong lensing arcs or counter-images are present.  \n\u2022 Absence of Ordered Disk Structure  \n  \u2013 No coherent spiral arms, bars, or dust lanes are traceable in either galaxy, implying severe dynamical heating and gas redistribution, typical once the disks have already interpenetrated.\n\n3. Additional Context & Interpretation  \n\u2022 Interaction Stage: The presence of a well-defined double nucleus plus a continuous tidal bridge indicates a mid-to-late merger stage (post-first-passage, pre-coalescence). Final core coalescence is likely within a few \u00d710^8 yr.  \n\u2022 Star-formation & AGN Prospects: The blue color of the secondary and mild central concentration of the primary hint at both merger-induced starbursts and a possible, currently weak AGN phase in the primary. Deep spectroscopy (e.g., H\u03b1, [O III]) would discriminate between starburst and AGN ionization.  \n\u2022 Mass Ratio: Judging by relative luminosities, the encounter appears to be near-major (mass ratio \u2272 3:1), which commonly leads to an eventual elliptical-like remnant.  \n\u2022 Future Evolution: Dynamical friction will bring the nuclei together, likely producing a single spheroidal remnant with a kinematically hot stellar component, tidal debris shells, and a central supermassive black-hole binary.  \n\u2022 Observational Needs: Higher-resolution multi-band imaging (e.g., HST/WFC3, JWST/NIRCam) and IFU spectroscopy (MUSE, KCWI) would enable decomposition of stellar populations, kinematics, and gas excitation across the bridge and nuclei, refining the timeline and energetics of the merger.", "input_tokens": 843, "output_tokens": 824, "decision_tree": [{"question": "smooth-or-featured", "answer": "smooth", "node": "smooth-or-featured_smooth", "votes": 35, "agreement": 0.778}, {"question": "how-rounded", "answer": "in-between", "node": "how-rounded_in-between", "votes": 26, "agreement": 0.743}, {"question": "merging", "answer": "merger", "node": "merging_merger", "votes": 41, "agreement": 0.976}], "iauname": "J073805.91+270750.4", "decision_tree_score": 0.3333333333333333, "judge_results": {"judge_decision_tree": {"overall_shape": "featured-or-disk", "roundness": null, "edge_on": "edge-on-no", "edge_on_bulge": null, "has_spiral_arms": "has-spiral-arms-no", "spiral_winding": null, "spiral_arm_count": null, "bar": "no", "bulge_size": "dominant", "merging": "merger"}, "judge_path": ["smooth-or-featured_featured-or-disk", "disk-edge-on_no", "has-spiral-arms_no", "bar_no", "bulge-size_dominant", "merging_merger"], "volunteer_path": ["smooth-or-featured_smooth", "how-rounded_in-between", "merging_merger"], "judge_prompt": "You are an expert astronomer who will classify a galaxy by following the same decision tree structure used by citizen scientists in Galaxy Zoo.\n\nYou will be given a galaxy description and must make decisions following this exact decision tree structure:\n\n**STEP 1: Overall Shape (Required)**\n- smooth: Galaxy appears smooth and featureless with no obvious structure\n- featured-or-disk: Galaxy shows clear structure like spiral arms, bars, or disk features  \n- artifact: Image appears to be a star, artifact, or defect rather than a galaxy\n\n**STEP 2: Follow the appropriate branch based on Step 1**\n\n**If SMOOTH:**\n- Determine roundness: round, in-between, cigar-shaped, or not-mentioned\n\n**If FEATURED-OR-DISK:**\n- Determine if edge-on: edge-on-yes, edge-on-no, or not-mentioned\n\n**If edge-on-yes:**\n- Determine bulge shape: boxy, none, rounded, or not-mentioned\n\n**If edge-on-no:**\n- Determine if has spiral arms: has-spiral-arms-yes, has-spiral-arms-no, or not-mentioned\n- If has spiral arms:\n  - Determine spiral winding: tight, medium, loose, or not-mentioned\n  - Determine arm count: 1, 2, 3, 4, more-than-4, cant-tell, or not-mentioned\n- For all non-edge-on galaxies (regardless of spiral arms):\n  - Determine bar strength: strong, weak, no, or not-mentioned\n  - Determine bulge size: dominant, large, moderate, small, none, or not-mentioned\n\n**STEP 3: Merging Status (ONLY for smooth and featured-or-disk galaxies, NOT artifacts)**\n- none: No signs of disturbance or interaction\n- minor-disturbance: Small distortions or asymmetries\n- major-disturbance: Significant warping, tidal features, or distortions\n- merger: Clear signs of ongoing merger or recent collision\n- not-mentioned: The description does not mention anything about merging or disturbance\n\n**IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:**\n- Base your decisions ONLY on what you can observe in the description\n- **Use \"not-mentioned\" for any field where the description does not provide sufficient information to make a determination**\n- Follow the decision tree logic - only fill out fields that are relevant for your path\n- Be definitive in your choices when information is available\n- **Merging status is ONLY asked for smooth and featured-or-disk galaxies, NOT for artifacts**\n- If the description is unclear about a specific feature, choose \"not-mentioned\" rather than guessing\n\n**GALAXY DESCRIPTION:**\n1.

Overall Morphology  \n   \u2022 The object is a single, moderately face-on disk galaxy whose light distribution is dominated by a smooth, luminous central bulge and a surrounding, loosely wound spiral/ring structure.  Its appearance is best described as an early-type spiral (Sa\u2013Sab) or \u201cpseudoring\u201d galaxy.  \n\n2. Prominent Features & Characteristics  \n   a) Bulge / Nucleus  \n      \u2013 A compact, nearly point-like nucleus sits at the photometric center, producing the highest surface-brightness pixel in the image.  \n      \u2013 The bulge is round and relatively smooth, typical of an Sa/Sab system; no obvious bar signature (i.e., an elongated plateau) is detected at the current resolution.  \n      \u2013 The central light concentration could be entirely stellar, but the slight blue\u2013white core color leaves open the possibility of a low-luminosity AGN.  \n\n   b) Inner Disk and Spiral Structure  \n      \u2013 Immediately outside the bulge, very low-contrast spiral structure is visible.  Two principal segments can be traced: one on the southeast (approaching) side, the other on the northwest (receding) side.  They appear broad and somewhat flocculent rather than sharply delineated, consistent with an early-type spiral that lacks strong density-wave arm definition.  \n      \u2013 The pitch angle is modest (~15\u201320\u00b0), again in line with Sa/Sab classification.  \n\n   c) Outer Pseudoring / Ring-like Feature  \n      \u2013 At ~2\u20133 bulge radii, the arms wrap around and nearly close into a diffuse, symmetric ring.  The ring is bluer than the inner disk, suggesting ongoing or recent star formation in the outer disk.  \n      \u2013 The ring shows no clear breaks, implying it is not a classical resonance ring produced by a bar; instead it may be the outer extent of the same spiral pattern.  \n\n   d) Localized Star-forming Knots  \n      \u2013 Two bluish clumps are visible along the southern segment of the ring, each subtending \u22641\u2033.  Their comparatively blue color indicates H II-region\u2013scale star formation sites.  \n\n   e) Dust and Extinction  \n      \u2013 No strong, dark dust lanes are obvious, consistent with a low to moderate inclination and/or a relatively early Hubble type with less clumpy dust distribution.  \n\n   f) Environment / Fore- and Background Sources  \n      \u2013 The field is sparse.  Faint, red, point-like sources scattered across the frame are consistent with background galaxies or distant halo stars.  None appear to be tidally interacting with the target.  \n      \u2013 No gravitational lensing arcs or multiple images are apparent.  \n\n3.

Overall Morphology  \n   \u2022 The object is a single, moderately face-on disk galaxy whose light distribution is dominated by a smooth, luminous central bulge and a surrounding, loosely wound spiral/ring structure.  Its appearance is best described as an early-type spiral (Sa\u2013Sab) or \u201cpseudoring\u201d galaxy.  \n\n2. Prominent Features & Characteristics  \n   a) Bulge / Nucleus  \n      \u2013 A compact, nearly point-like nucleus sits at the photometric center, producing the highest surface-brightness pixel in the image.  \n      \u2013 The bulge is round and relatively smooth, typical of an Sa/Sab system; no obvious bar signature (i.e., an elongated plateau) is detected at the current resolution.  \n      \u2013 The central light concentration could be entirely stellar, but the slight blue\u2013white core color leaves open the possibility of a low-luminosity AGN.  \n\n   b) Inner Disk and Spiral Structure  \n      \u2013 Immediately outside the bulge, very low-contrast spiral structure is visible.  Two principal segments can be traced: one on the southeast (approaching) side, the other on the northwest (receding) side.  They appear broad and somewhat flocculent rather than sharply delineated, consistent with an early-type spiral that lacks strong density-wave arm definition.  \n      \u2013 The pitch angle is modest (~15\u201320\u00b0), again in line with Sa/Sab classification.  \n\n   c) Outer Pseudoring / Ring-like Feature  \n      \u2013 At ~2\u20133 bulge radii, the arms wrap around and nearly close into a diffuse, symmetric ring.  The ring is bluer than the inner disk, suggesting ongoing or recent star formation in the outer disk.  \n      \u2013 The ring shows no clear breaks, implying it is not a classical resonance ring produced by a bar; instead it may be the outer extent of the same spiral pattern.  \n\n   d) Localized Star-forming Knots  \n      \u2013 Two bluish clumps are visible along the southern segment of the ring, each subtending \u22641\u2033.  Their comparatively blue color indicates H II-region\u2013scale star formation sites.  \n\n   e) Dust and Extinction  \n      \u2013 No strong, dark dust lanes are obvious, consistent with a low to moderate inclination and/or a relatively early Hubble type with less clumpy dust distribution.  \n\n   f) Environment / Fore- and Background Sources  \n      \u2013 The field is sparse.  Faint, red, point-like sources scattered across the frame are consistent with background galaxies or distant halo stars.  None appear to be tidally interacting with the target.  \n      \u2013 No gravitational lensing arcs or multiple images are apparent.  \n\n3. Additional Context & Interpretation  \n   \u2022 The combination of a luminous bulge, tightly wrapped arms, and a near-closed outer ring suggests the galaxy is at or just beyond the transition between early barred (SBa) and unbarred (Sa) spirals, but without a prominent bar the system is most naturally classified as SA(r)a\u2013SA(r)ab.  \n   \u2022 The pseudoring morphology can originate from a spiral density wave whose arms overlap in azimuth at outer radii; it may also reflect a past minor accretion event that induced a symmetric outer star-forming ring.  \n   \u2022 The nucleus\u2019 slight blue excess raises the possibility of weak nuclear activity (LINER/Seyfert 2).

Overall Morphology  \nThe central object is most consistent with a close\u2010pair or ongoing minor merger between two compact, blue, star-forming galaxies.  No well-defined grand-design spiral pattern or smooth elliptical light profile is evident; instead the luminosity is concentrated in two adjacent knots of comparable surface brightness separated by \u22721\u2033, embedded in a common, faint, diffuse envelope.  The system therefore falls under the \u201cinteracting/merging irregular\u201d class rather than a settled spiral or elliptical morphology.\n\n2. Prominent Features & Characteristics  \n\u2022 Dual blue knots:  The brighter north-western component and the slightly fainter south-eastern component both exhibit a blue continuum, indicative of recent or ongoing star formation.  Each knot is marginally resolved, with FWHM only marginally larger than field stars, suggesting diameters of a few kpc at z \u2272 0.1\u20130.3 (depending on survey depth).  \n\u2022 Distorted envelope / tidal overlap:  Low-surface-brightness emission surrounds the pair, connecting the two knots.  This diffuse light is elongated roughly NW\u2013SE, implying tidal overlap or the early stage of disc/disc coalescence.  \n\u2022 Absence of ordered arms or bar:  No coherent spiral arms, bar, or dust lanes are discernible at the given resolution, reinforcing the interpretation that the system is dynamically disturbed.  \n\u2022 Nearby sources:  \n  \u2013 A red point-source ~3\u2033 north of the merger (likely a foreground M-dwarf or a compact background galaxy with a strong 4000-\u00c5 break).  \n  \u2013 A faint, elongated blue smudge ~4\u2033 south-east which may be an unrelated background dwarf or a tidal fragment stripped from the main interacting pair.  \n  \u2013 Several sub-arcsecond faint points scattered across the field, consistent with background galaxies or field stars; no obvious strong-lensing arcs are present.  \n\u2022 No clear AGN signature:  There is no unresolved central point source dominating the light, so any active nucleus, if present, is not optically luminous at this depth.\n\n3. Additional Context & Interpretation  \nThe blue colour of both nuclei and the surrounding envelope suggests enhanced, interaction-triggered star formation on timescales \u2272100 Myr.

Overall Morphology  \nThe central object is most consistent with a close\u2010pair or ongoing minor merger between two compact, blue, star-forming galaxies.  No well-defined grand-design spiral pattern or smooth elliptical light profile is evident; instead the luminosity is concentrated in two adjacent knots of comparable surface brightness separated by \u22721\u2033, embedded in a common, faint, diffuse envelope.  The system therefore falls under the \u201cinteracting/merging irregular\u201d class rather than a settled spiral or elliptical morphology.\n\n2. Prominent Features & Characteristics  \n\u2022 Dual blue knots:  The brighter north-western component and the slightly fainter south-eastern component both exhibit a blue continuum, indicative of recent or ongoing star formation.  Each knot is marginally resolved, with FWHM only marginally larger than field stars, suggesting diameters of a few kpc at z \u2272 0.1\u20130.3 (depending on survey depth).  \n\u2022 Distorted envelope / tidal overlap:  Low-surface-brightness emission surrounds the pair, connecting the two knots.  This diffuse light is elongated roughly NW\u2013SE, implying tidal overlap or the early stage of disc/disc coalescence.  \n\u2022 Absence of ordered arms or bar:  No coherent spiral arms, bar, or dust lanes are discernible at the given resolution, reinforcing the interpretation that the system is dynamically disturbed.  \n\u2022 Nearby sources:  \n  \u2013 A red point-source ~3\u2033 north of the merger (likely a foreground M-dwarf or a compact background galaxy with a strong 4000-\u00c5 break).  \n  \u2013 A faint, elongated blue smudge ~4\u2033 south-east which may be an unrelated background dwarf or a tidal fragment stripped from the main interacting pair.  \n  \u2013 Several sub-arcsecond faint points scattered across the field, consistent with background galaxies or field stars; no obvious strong-lensing arcs are present.  \n\u2022 No clear AGN signature:  There is no unresolved central point source dominating the light, so any active nucleus, if present, is not optically luminous at this depth.\n\n3. Additional Context & Interpretation  \nThe blue colour of both nuclei and the surrounding envelope suggests enhanced, interaction-triggered star formation on timescales \u2272100 Myr.  The lack of extended tidal tails implies the merger is either (a) at an early passage where tidal features have not yet fully developed or (b) a minor interaction with limited angular-momentum exchange.  Deeper imaging or IFU spectroscopy could test for shocked gas and quantify star-formation rates via H\u03b1 or [O II].  Kinematic mapping would determine whether the pair is bound and measure the mass ratio; if the south-eastern component is \u227230 % the mass of the primary, this would classify as a minor merger likely to build a thickened disc or pseudobulge in the remnant.\n\nClassify this galaxy by following the decision tree structure above."}, "judge_model": "gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20", "judge_thinking_budget": 24000}

They are too faint for firm classification here.  \n\n\u2022 Absence of obvious interaction signatures  \n  \u2013 No bridges, tails, shells, or asymmetries that would signal a recent major merger.  The halo appears smooth, with no detectable tidal distortions at the depth of this image.  \n\n3. Additional Context & Interpretation  \n\n\u2022 Host classification:  The object\u2019s smooth light profile and color suggest an old, metal-rich stellar population typical of elliptical/S0 galaxies.  If the slight ellipticity flattens into a measurable disk at larger radii, the galaxy would be cataloged as an S0; otherwise it would be classed E0\u2013E1.  \n\n\u2022 Potential AGN:  Although a bright nucleus is present, no obvious non-stellar features (jets, ionization cones) are visible, so any AGN would have to be of low luminosity or obscured.  Spectroscopy would be needed to test for a LINER or low-luminosity Seyfert component.  \n\n\u2022 Environmental clues:  The cleanliness of the halo and lack of tidal debris imply either isolation or a dynamically relaxed environment where any past minor mergers have already phase-mixed.  \n\n\u2022 Follow-up recommendations:  \n  \u2013 Deep multi-band imaging to search for faint shells or disk structure that would refine the E/S0 classification.  \n  \u2013 Spectroscopy of the blue point source to establish its nature (foreground star vs. transient vs. satellite).  \n  \u2013 Surface-brightness profile fitting (e.g., S\u00e9rsic index) to quantify bulge vs. disk contributions and constrain the galaxy\u2019s evolutionary history.\n\nClassify this galaxy by following the decision tree structure above."}, "judge_model": "gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20", "judge_thinking_budget": 24000}

Overall Morphology  \nThe frame is dominated by a single, highly\u2010inclined (essentially edge-on) disc galaxy. Its axial ratio is very large (major axis \u227315\u201320\u00d7 minor axis), indicative of a thin stellar disc seen within a few degrees of 90\u00b0 inclination. No obvious bulge is resolved, suggesting that the system is either an Sd/Sc late-type spiral with a very small central spheroid or a pure disc S0.\n\n2. Prominent Features & Characteristics  \n\n\u2022 Stellar Disc  \n  \u2013 Morphology/extent: The disc extends diagonally across the field from lower-left to upper-right with a projected length of \u227325\u2033 in the displayed cutout. The surface-brightness profile is smooth and exponential-like, lacking clear substructure.  \n  \u2013 Colour gradient: The inner \u223c40 % of the visible disc shows a slightly redder (g\u2013r) colour, while the outer disc is comparatively bluer, consistent with an older stellar population (or mild internal extinction) toward the centre and younger, lower-metallicity populations outward.  \n\n\u2022 Mid-plane/Dust lane  \n  \u2013 A narrow, low-contrast dark lane is not conspicuous, implying that either (a) the disc contains little cold ISM/dust, or (b) the galaxy is inclined but not exactly edge-on (i \u2248 85\u00b0), so the dust column is insufficient to produce a prominent lane.  \n\n\u2022 Bulge / Central concentration  \n  \u2013 There is no obvious central luminosity excess above the disc profile; a classical bulge component is therefore weak or absent. Any pseudo-bulge, if present, is unresolved at this image scale.  \n\n\u2022 Halo / Thick disc  \n  \u2013 The light falls off rapidly perpendicular to the mid-plane, with no detectable thick-disc or stellar halo envelope in the current depth.  \n\n\u2022 Environment & background sources  \n  \u2013 Several faint, red, likely background galaxies are visible as diffuse, round sources in the surrounding field. Point-like objects with PSF profiles are sparse; no bright foreground MW stars contaminate the immediate vicinity.  \n  \u2013 No tidal streams, shells, or asymmetric extensions are detected down to the image\u2019s surface-brightness limit.  \n\n\u2022 Absence of AGN/compact core  \n  \u2013 No central point source or colour signature suggestive of an unobscured AGN is present. The nucleus blends smoothly into the inner disc light.  \n\n3. Additional Context & Interpretation  \n\n\u2022 Classification: The absence of a significant bulge, together with the thin, featureless disc, is characteristic of a late-type bulgeless spiral (Sd) or a low-mass lenticular (S0c) with little current star formation.

Overall Morphology  \nThe frame is dominated by a single, highly\u2010inclined (essentially edge-on) disc galaxy. Its axial ratio is very large (major axis \u227315\u201320\u00d7 minor axis), indicative of a thin stellar disc seen within a few degrees of 90\u00b0 inclination. No obvious bulge is resolved, suggesting that the system is either an Sd/Sc late-type spiral with a very small central spheroid or a pure disc S0.\n\n2. Prominent Features & Characteristics  \n\n\u2022 Stellar Disc  \n  \u2013 Morphology/extent: The disc extends diagonally across the field from lower-left to upper-right with a projected length of \u227325\u2033 in the displayed cutout. The surface-brightness profile is smooth and exponential-like, lacking clear substructure.  \n  \u2013 Colour gradient: The inner \u223c40 % of the visible disc shows a slightly redder (g\u2013r) colour, while the outer disc is comparatively bluer, consistent with an older stellar population (or mild internal extinction) toward the centre and younger, lower-metallicity populations outward.  \n\n\u2022 Mid-plane/Dust lane  \n  \u2013 A narrow, low-contrast dark lane is not conspicuous, implying that either (a) the disc contains little cold ISM/dust, or (b) the galaxy is inclined but not exactly edge-on (i \u2248 85\u00b0), so the dust column is insufficient to produce a prominent lane.  \n\n\u2022 Bulge / Central concentration  \n  \u2013 There is no obvious central luminosity excess above the disc profile; a classical bulge component is therefore weak or absent. Any pseudo-bulge, if present, is unresolved at this image scale.  \n\n\u2022 Halo / Thick disc  \n  \u2013 The light falls off rapidly perpendicular to the mid-plane, with no detectable thick-disc or stellar halo envelope in the current depth.  \n\n\u2022 Environment & background sources  \n  \u2013 Several faint, red, likely background galaxies are visible as diffuse, round sources in the surrounding field. Point-like objects with PSF profiles are sparse; no bright foreground MW stars contaminate the immediate vicinity.  \n  \u2013 No tidal streams, shells, or asymmetric extensions are detected down to the image\u2019s surface-brightness limit.  \n\n\u2022 Absence of AGN/compact core  \n  \u2013 No central point source or colour signature suggestive of an unobscured AGN is present. The nucleus blends smoothly into the inner disc light.  \n\n3. Additional Context & Interpretation  \n\n\u2022 Classification: The absence of a significant bulge, together with the thin, featureless disc, is characteristic of a late-type bulgeless spiral (Sd) or a low-mass lenticular (S0c) with little current star formation. The modest internal reddening could be due to a diffuse dust component rather than dense molecular clouds.  \n\n\u2022 Star-formation activity: The blue outer disc hints at ongoing or recent star formation in the periphery, whereas the redder mid-disc may indicate older populations and/or low-level extinction. No discrete H II complexes are resolved at this resolution.  \n\n\u2022 Evolutionary state: The galaxy appears dynamically undisturbed; lack of warps, flares, or tidal debris implies no recent strong gravitational interaction. Its pristine, razor-thin disc suggests a quiescent merger history and relatively low external perturbations.  \n\n\u2022 Potential follow-up: Deeper imaging could reveal a faint thick disc or halo component; IFU spectroscopy would constrain rotation curve, stellar populations, and quantify any low-level star formation or ionized gas.\n\nClassify this galaxy by following the decision tree structure above."}, "judge_model": "gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20", "judge_thinking_budget": 24000}

Overall Morphology  \nThe field is dominated by an interacting/merging galaxy pair.  \n\u2022 Primary component (southern-western object): compact, centrally peaked, nearly round light profile with only a hint of an extended envelope\u2014consistent with an early-type disk (S0) or a low-luminosity elliptical.  \n\u2022 Secondary component (north-eastern object): markedly bluer, less centrally concentrated, and elongated; it exhibits a narrow, curved extension (tidal tail or plume) that projects further to the north-east.  \nThe configuration and mutual proximity (projected separation \u2272 one effective radius of the primary) place the system in an early\u2010to\u2010mid stage of a minor or unequal-mass merger.\n\n2. Prominent Features & Characteristics  \na. Tidal Tail / Plume  \n\u2022 Originates from the blue secondary, curves gently toward PA \u2248 30\u00b0 (measured N through E), and extends \u22731.5\u20132\u00d7 the secondary\u2019s semi-major axis.  \n\u2022 Surface brightness drops smoothly along the tail, suggesting continual stripping rather than discrete clumps; the blue colour points to recent star formation in freshly stripped gas.  \n\nb. Colour Contrast  \n\u2022 Primary: white-to-slightly-yellow hue \u2192 older, more metal-rich stellar population with little current star formation.  \n\u2022 Secondary + tail: pronounced blue continuum \u2192 vigorous star formation, likely triggered by tidal torques and gas inflow.  \n\nc. Nuclei  \n\u2022 Both galaxies show single, unresolved central light concentrations. No obvious double nucleus or offset peak is visible at this resolution, but the primary\u2019s nuclear point source is marginally brighter, leaving open the possibility of a weak AGN or a compact nuclear starburst.  \n\nd. Possible Stellar Halo/Envelope  \n\u2022 A very faint, diffuse glow is discernible around the primary on the south-western side, compatible with outer disk/halo light or early tidal debris. No clear shell structure is detected.  \n\ne. Foreground / Background Sources  \n\u2022 Several reddish point sources scattered across the frame are consistent with background galaxies or Galactic stars; none appear physically associated with the pair. No lensing arcs or other distortions are observed.\n\n3. Additional Context & Interpretation  \n\u2022 Interaction Stage: The modest length of the tidal feature and the intact individual nuclei suggest a first-pass or early second-pass encounter. Dynamical friction will likely lead to coalescence within a few \u00d710^8 yr.  \n\u2022 Star-Formation Enhancement: The blue colour and high surface brightness of the secondary and its tail imply star-formation rates elevated above typical field dwarfs of comparable mass, consistent with merger-induced gas compression.  \n\u2022 Mass Ratio: Luminosity contrast (~2\u20133:1 in the optical) points to a minor merger scenario. The secondary could be a gas-rich dwarf or small spiral being accreted by a more massive, gas-poor host.  \n\u2022 Future Evolution: The merger will probably build up the stellar halo of the primary and may rejuvenate its central regions.

Tidal Tail / Plume  \n\u2022 Originates from the blue secondary, curves gently toward PA \u2248 30\u00b0 (measured N through E), and extends \u22731.5\u20132\u00d7 the secondary\u2019s semi-major axis.  \n\u2022 Surface brightness drops smoothly along the tail, suggesting continual stripping rather than discrete clumps; the blue colour points to recent star formation in freshly stripped gas.  \n\nb. Colour Contrast  \n\u2022 Primary: white-to-slightly-yellow hue \u2192 older, more metal-rich stellar population with little current star formation.  \n\u2022 Secondary + tail: pronounced blue continuum \u2192 vigorous star formation, likely triggered by tidal torques and gas inflow.  \n\nc. Nuclei  \n\u2022 Both galaxies show single, unresolved central light concentrations. No obvious double nucleus or offset peak is visible at this resolution, but the primary\u2019s nuclear point source is marginally brighter, leaving open the possibility of a weak AGN or a compact nuclear starburst.  \n\nd. Possible Stellar Halo/Envelope  \n\u2022 A very faint, diffuse glow is discernible around the primary on the south-western side, compatible with outer disk/halo light or early tidal debris. No clear shell structure is detected.  \n\ne. Foreground / Background Sources  \n\u2022 Several reddish point sources scattered across the frame are consistent with background galaxies or Galactic stars; none appear physically associated with the pair. No lensing arcs or other distortions are observed.\n\n3. Additional Context & Interpretation  \n\u2022 Interaction Stage: The modest length of the tidal feature and the intact individual nuclei suggest a first-pass or early second-pass encounter. Dynamical friction will likely lead to coalescence within a few \u00d710^8 yr.  \n\u2022 Star-Formation Enhancement: The blue colour and high surface brightness of the secondary and its tail imply star-formation rates elevated above typical field dwarfs of comparable mass, consistent with merger-induced gas compression.  \n\u2022 Mass Ratio: Luminosity contrast (~2\u20133:1 in the optical) points to a minor merger scenario. The secondary could be a gas-rich dwarf or small spiral being accreted by a more massive, gas-poor host.  \n\u2022 Future Evolution: The merger will probably build up the stellar halo of the primary and may rejuvenate its central regions. If either nucleus hosts a SMBH, a transient dual-AGN phase could occur as separations shrink below ~kpc scales.\n\nNo evidence for gravitational lensing, large-scale dust lanes, or well-defined spiral structure is present within the resolution and depth of this image.\n\nClassify this galaxy by following the decision tree structure above."}, "judge_model": "gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20", "judge_thinking_budget": 24000}

Overall Morphology  \n   \u2022 The dominant object is a luminous, nearly face-on disk galaxy that falls within the late-type spiral/peculiar class (\u2248 SABc\u2013Sm).  \n   \u2022 The disk appears dynamically disturbed: instead of a well-defined grand-design two-arm pattern, a single, loosely wrapped arm or partial outer ring is visible, suggesting either a one-armed (m = 1) spiral or a tidal loop.  \n   \u2022 The central region contains a bright, compact bulge/inner\u2010disk component with a smooth light profile, weakly suggestive of a low-contrast bar or oval distortion.\n\n2. Prominent Features & Characteristics  \n   a. Disk / Spiral Structure  \n      \u2013 A diffuse, blue-weighted outer structure extends \u2273 1.5 \u00d7 the bulge radius, forming a broad asymmetric arm that winds \u223c 270\u00b0 around the nucleus (clockwise in the image frame).  \n      \u2013 The arm has a mottled texture and slight color contrast (bluer than the core), indicative of moderate star-forming activity.  \n      \u2013 No clear multi-arm symmetry; the m = 1 dominance and the faintness of the counter-arm point to either tidal perturbation or a lopsided instability.  \n\n   b. Central Bulge / Possible Bar  \n      \u2013 The inner \u2272 2\u2033 (image centre) is smooth, yellow-white, and round to slightly oval.  \n      \u2013 No sharp dust lanes cross the core, and the color is relatively redder than the surrounding disk, consistent with an evolved stellar population.  \n      \u2013 A subtle elongation along PA \u2248 20\u00b0 could be an inner oval/bar, though its contrast is low.  \n\n   c. Star-forming Knots  \n      \u2013 Several resolved, blue clumps are embedded in the outer arm; they span \u2272 0.3\u2033 each and trace sites of recent OB-star formation.  \n      \u2013 A distinctly orange point source just west of the nucleus is visible; its red color suggests either (i) a foreground Galactic star or (ii) a compact, dust-enshrouded H II region/SN remnant. No PSF diffraction spikes are resolved, leaving the classification ambiguous.  \n\n   d. Tidal / Outer Features  \n      \u2013 A very low-surface-brightness, arc-like envelope surrounds the main disk on the NE side, detached from the brighter arm. This could be a tidal loop or shell generated by a minor merger.  \n      \u2013 No companion galaxy is obvious within the frame, but the lopsidedness and outer arc argue for an interaction within the past few hundred Myr.  \n\n   e.

Overall Morphology  \n   \u2022 The dominant object is a luminous, nearly face-on disk galaxy that falls within the late-type spiral/peculiar class (\u2248 SABc\u2013Sm).  \n   \u2022 The disk appears dynamically disturbed: instead of a well-defined grand-design two-arm pattern, a single, loosely wrapped arm or partial outer ring is visible, suggesting either a one-armed (m = 1) spiral or a tidal loop.  \n   \u2022 The central region contains a bright, compact bulge/inner\u2010disk component with a smooth light profile, weakly suggestive of a low-contrast bar or oval distortion.\n\n2. Prominent Features & Characteristics  \n   a. Disk / Spiral Structure  \n      \u2013 A diffuse, blue-weighted outer structure extends \u2273 1.5 \u00d7 the bulge radius, forming a broad asymmetric arm that winds \u223c 270\u00b0 around the nucleus (clockwise in the image frame).  \n      \u2013 The arm has a mottled texture and slight color contrast (bluer than the core), indicative of moderate star-forming activity.  \n      \u2013 No clear multi-arm symmetry; the m = 1 dominance and the faintness of the counter-arm point to either tidal perturbation or a lopsided instability.  \n\n   b. Central Bulge / Possible Bar  \n      \u2013 The inner \u2272 2\u2033 (image centre) is smooth, yellow-white, and round to slightly oval.  \n      \u2013 No sharp dust lanes cross the core, and the color is relatively redder than the surrounding disk, consistent with an evolved stellar population.  \n      \u2013 A subtle elongation along PA \u2248 20\u00b0 could be an inner oval/bar, though its contrast is low.  \n\n   c. Star-forming Knots  \n      \u2013 Several resolved, blue clumps are embedded in the outer arm; they span \u2272 0.3\u2033 each and trace sites of recent OB-star formation.  \n      \u2013 A distinctly orange point source just west of the nucleus is visible; its red color suggests either (i) a foreground Galactic star or (ii) a compact, dust-enshrouded H II region/SN remnant. No PSF diffraction spikes are resolved, leaving the classification ambiguous.  \n\n   d. Tidal / Outer Features  \n      \u2013 A very low-surface-brightness, arc-like envelope surrounds the main disk on the NE side, detached from the brighter arm. This could be a tidal loop or shell generated by a minor merger.  \n      \u2013 No companion galaxy is obvious within the frame, but the lopsidedness and outer arc argue for an interaction within the past few hundred Myr.  \n\n   e. Foreground / Background Objects  \n      \u2013 A saturated, yellow-green point source in the lower left quadrant is almost certainly a foreground Milky Way star (PSF-like, no extended halo).  \n      \u2013 Faint background sources are scant; the field is otherwise clean of bright contaminants, aiding morphological interpretation.  \n\n3. Additional Context & Interpretation  \n   \u2022 Morphological clues (single dominant arm, outer tidal arc, mild bulge oval) favor a scenario in which a low-mass satellite has recently interacted with, or is in the process of merging into, the primary disk. Such encounters drive m = 1 modes, asymmetries, and elevated but patchy star formation.  \n   \u2022 The nucleus shows no obvious point-like excess or strong blue/UV component; if an AGN is present it is weak (low-luminosity Seyfert/LINER at most).  \n   \u2022 Absence of pronounced dust lanes perpendicular to the bar rules out a strong bar-driven inflow phase; any bar present is likely dynamically young or being dissolved by the interaction.  \n   \u2022 Follow-up IFU spectroscopy could map the kinematic lopsidedness and quantify any counter-rotating gas, while deep imaging would reveal the full extent and geometry of the tidal debris.\n\nClassify this galaxy by following the decision tree structure above."}, "judge_model": "gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20", "judge_thinking_budget": 24000}

No discernible dust lanes.  \n   c. Companion galaxy / satellite  \n      \u2013 Compact, yellow object ~1 mag fainter than the host; half-light radius <0.5\u2033.  \n      \u2013 Projected separation \u22480.7\u20131.0 host-effective-radii; color comparable to the host\u2019s outer regions, implying an evolved stellar population.  \n      \u2013 No tidal tails or bridges visible at the present depth, but its proximity suggests dynamical interaction on a short merging timescale.  \n   d.

No obvious tidal bridge is seen, but the projected separation is small enough that weak tidal distortion cannot be ruled out.  \n\n   c) Field sources  \n      \u2013 A compact blue source SSW of the central galaxy and a red, unresolved object NNE are most likely background galaxies at higher redshift.  \n      \u2013 Several point-like objects with stellar PSF are present; they are foreground Galactic stars and do not display diffraction spikes at this stretch.\n\n3. Additional Context & Interpretation  \n   \u2022 Environment: The field appears to host multiple small galaxies within a few tens of kpc, suggestive of a poor group or the outskirts of a cluster.  \n   \u2022 Interaction scenario: The proximity and contrasting colours of the two brightest galaxies hint at minor-merger activity. Tidal signatures are weak, probably because the interaction is at an early stage or because the mass ratio is modest (\u22481:5).  \n   \u2022 Evolutionary state: The central S0/Sa could be a formerly gas-rich spiral that has quenched star formation, while the blue companion continues active star formation. Ongoing interaction may trigger limited central activity (low-luminosity AGN) in the primary.  \n   \u2022 No strong gravitational lensing artifacts, extended tidal tails, or pronounced dust lanes are detected within the current depth and resolution.\n\nThese observations are consistent with a small, dynamically young galaxy pair in a low-density environment, with the main galaxy transitioning toward passive evolution while a less massive companion remains actively star-forming.\n\nClassify this galaxy by following the decision tree structure above."}, "judge_model": "gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20", "judge_thinking_budget": 24000}

Overall Morphology  \n\u2022 The dominant source is a single, nearly face-on disk galaxy that can be broadly classified as a barred spiral (SB) exhibiting a closed or partially closed outer ring (R).  \n\u2022 No obvious companion of comparable mass is present in the immediate vicinity, so the system is interpreted as an isolated galaxy rather than an ongoing major merger.\n\n2. Prominent Features & Characteristics  \na. Central luminosity concentration / bar  \n   \u2013 The inner ~2\u20133\u2033 is marked by an elongated, high-surface-brightness structure whose major axis is oriented roughly NNE\u2013SSW (position angle \u2248 20\u201330\u00b0 east of north).  \n   \u2013 The axis ratio is \u2272 0.6, flatter than the surrounding disk light, supporting the identification as a stellar bar rather than a point-like AGN.  \n   \u2013 The bar terminates abruptly where a change in isophotal ellipticity is seen, consistent with the location of the bar end and the beginning of the inner ring.\n\nb. Inner/outer pseudo-ring  \n   \u2013 Surrounding the bar is a low-surface-brightness, nearly circular ring or tightly wound spiral arm bundle with a radius of \u2248 4\u20135\u2033.  The ring is azimuthally continuous over \u2265 270\u00b0, lacking the sharp discontinuities typical of tidal debris.  \n   \u2013 The ring appears slightly asymmetric: the NW quadrant is marginally brighter, suggesting either a mild lopsidedness or patchy star formation.  \n   \u2013 The colour (blue-white in SDSS gri composite) is bluer than the bar/core, indicating a younger stellar population and/or moderate ongoing star formation.\n\nc. Disk / faint outer envelope  \n   \u2013 Beyond the ring, only a very faint diffuse envelope is visible; no grand-design spiral arms can be traced confidently outside the ring.  The disk therefore transitions rapidly into the sky background, typical of ringed early-type spirals (SBa\u2013SB0/a).  \n\nd. Dust and star-forming clumps  \n   \u2013 No strong, resolved dust lanes are detected at this spatial resolution, implying either a relatively low dust content or a face-on orientation minimising projected extinction features.  \n   \u2013 Localised clumps (sub-arcsec scale) along the ring exhibit slightly enhanced blue colours, consistent with H II regions but below the resolution required to delineate individual knots.\n\ne. Fore-/background objects and lensing assessment  \n   \u2013 Several red, unresolved point sources in the field are consistent with background galaxies or MW halo stars; none show morphological distortion or counter-images that would suggest gravitational lensing by the primary galaxy.  \n   \u2013 The luminous ring is centred on, and symmetrically encloses, the stellar bar, with no multiple imaging; hence the structure is interpreted as an internal resonance ring rather than an Einstein ring.\n\n3. Additional Context & Interpretation  \n\u2022 The bar-plus-ring morphology is characteristic of galaxies where the bar drives gas to the outer Lindblad resonance (OLR), triggering ring star formation.  The relative brightness contrast between bar and ring suggests recent or ongoing gas inflow.  \n\u2022 Absence of strong tidal tails, shells, or off-centred isophotes argues against a recent major merger; any interactions are likely minor or long past.  \n\u2022 If spectroscopic data were available, one would expect enhanced H\u03b1 and [O II] emission in the ring and relatively older, metal-richer stellar populations in the bar/bulge.  \n\u2022 The system may provide a useful laboratory for studying bar-driven secular evolution and the role of resonances in structuring disk galaxies.", "input_tokens": 843, "output_tokens": 819, "decision_tree": [{"question": "smooth-or-featured", "answer": "featured-or-disk", "node": "smooth-or-featured_featured-or-disk", "votes": 35, "agreement": 0.875}, {"question": "disk-edge-on", "answer": "no", "node": "disk-edge-on_no", "votes": 35, "agreement": 1.0}, {"question": "has-spiral-arms", "answer": "yes", "node": "has-spiral-arms_yes", "votes": 35, "agreement": 1.0}, {"question": "spiral-winding", "answer": "medium", "node": "spiral-winding_medium", "votes": 27, "agreement": 0.771}, {"question": "spiral-arm-count", "answer": "2", "node": "spiral-arm-count_2", "votes": 34, "agreement": 0.971}, {"question": "bar", "answer": "strong", "node": "bar_strong", "votes": 30, "agreement": 0.857}, {"question": "bulge-size", "answer": "moderate", "node": "bulge-size_moderate", "votes": 26, "agreement": 0.743}, {"question": "merging", "answer": "none", "node": "merging_none", "votes": 33, "agreement": 0.868}], "iauname": "J133324.74+174341.3", "decision_tree_score": 0.5, "judge_results": {"judge_decision_tree": {"overall_shape": "featured-or-disk", "roundness": null, "edge_on": "edge-on-no", "edge_on_bulge": null, "has_spiral_arms": "has-spiral-arms-yes", "spiral_winding": "tight", "spiral_arm_count": "cant-tell", "bar": "strong", "bulge_size": "not-mentioned", "merging": "minor-disturbance"}, "judge_path": ["smooth-or-featured_featured-or-disk", "disk-edge-on_no", "has-spiral-arms_yes", "spiral-winding_tight", "spiral-arm-count_cant-tell", "bar_strong", "bulge-size-not-mentioned", "merging_minor-disturbance"], "volunteer_path": ["smooth-or-featured_featured-or-disk", "disk-edge-on_no", "has-spiral-arms_yes", "spiral-winding_medium", "spiral-arm-count_2", "bar_strong", "bulge-size_moderate", "merging_none"], "judge_prompt": "You are an expert astronomer who will classify a galaxy by following the same decision tree structure used by citizen scientists in Galaxy Zoo.\n\nYou will be given a galaxy description and must make decisions following this exact decision tree structure:\n\n**STEP 1: Overall Shape (Required)**\n- smooth: Galaxy appears smooth and featureless with no obvious structure\n- featured-or-disk: Galaxy shows clear structure like spiral arms, bars, or disk features  \n- artifact: Image appears to be a star, artifact, or defect rather than a galaxy\n\n**STEP 2: Follow the appropriate branch based on Step 1**\n\n**If SMOOTH:**\n- Determine roundness: round, in-between, cigar-shaped, or not-mentioned\n\n**If FEATURED-OR-DISK:**\n- Determine if edge-on: edge-on-yes, edge-on-no, or not-mentioned\n\n**If edge-on-yes:**\n- Determine bulge shape: boxy, none, rounded, or not-mentioned\n\n**If edge-on-no:**\n- Determine if has spiral arms: has-spiral-arms-yes, has-spiral-arms-no, or not-mentioned\n- If has spiral arms:\n  - Determine spiral winding: tight, medium, loose, or not-mentioned\n  - Determine arm count: 1, 2, 3, 4, more-than-4, cant-tell, or not-mentioned\n- For all non-edge-on galaxies (regardless of spiral arms):\n  - Determine bar strength: strong, weak, no, or not-mentioned\n  - Determine bulge size: dominant, large, moderate, small, none, or not-mentioned\n\n**STEP 3: Merging Status (ONLY for smooth and featured-or-disk galaxies, NOT artifacts)**\n- none: No signs of disturbance or interaction\n- minor-disturbance: Small distortions or asymmetries\n- major-disturbance: Significant warping, tidal features, or distortions\n- merger: Clear signs of ongoing merger or recent collision\n- not-mentioned: The description does not mention anything about merging or disturbance\n\n**IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:**\n- Base your decisions ONLY on what you can observe in the description\n- **Use \"not-mentioned\" for any field where the description does not provide sufficient information to make a determination**\n- Follow the decision tree logic - only fill out fields that are relevant for your path\n- Be definitive in your choices when information is available\n- **Merging status is ONLY asked for smooth and featured-or-disk galaxies, NOT for artifacts**\n- If the description is unclear about a specific feature, choose \"not-mentioned\" rather than guessing\n\n**GALAXY DESCRIPTION:**\n1.

Overall Morphology  \n   \u2022 The dominant object is an early-type galaxy whose light distribution is smooth, centrally concentrated, and nearly circularly symmetric.  The absence of discernible spiral structure, a bar, or patchy star-forming regions places it in the elliptical class, most likely E0\u2013E1 (slightly flattened but close to round).\n\n2. Prominent Features & Characteristics  \n   a) Stellar light profile  \n      \u2022 The surface\u2013brightness profile shows a steep inner core transitioning to an extended, shallow envelope.  A de Vaucouleurs (r^1/4) law would plausibly fit the radial profile.  \n      \u2022 The outer isophotes are faint but detectable, indicating a low-surface-brightness halo that gradually blends into the sky background.\n\n   b) Nuclear properties  \n      \u2022 The innermost \u22721\u20132\u2033 is distinctly bluer (cyan/white in the RGB composite) than the surrounding halo, hinting at either (i) a weak low-ionization nuclear emission region (LINER/AGN) or (ii) a modest sprinkling of younger/intermediate-age stars.  No clear point-source PSF spike structure is visible, so if an AGN is present it is of low optical luminosity.\n\n   c) Absence of internal substructure  \n      \u2022 No bars, dust lanes, shells, boxy isophotes, or tidal plumes are apparent down to the image depth.  The light appears smooth at all radii barring minor Poisson noise.\n\n   d) Environmental companions  \n      \u2022 A small, edge-on late-type galaxy (yellow\u2013green, elongated, left of the main object) lies at a projected separation of \u224810\u2033.  Its color and flattening suggest a disk with moderate ongoing star formation.  \n      \u2022 Several red, compact sources (likely background galaxies) and a few point-like stellar objects populate the field.  None show obvious tidal distortions connecting them to the elliptical, implying no strong ongoing interaction.\n\n3. Additional Context & Interpretation  \n   \u2022 The smooth morphology and extended halo are consistent with a dynamically relaxed system in a group or cluster environment, possibly a brightest group galaxy (BGG) or a low-luminosity cD analog.  \n   \u2022 The blue nuclear tint may reflect low-level gas accretion fueling either residual star formation (<1 M\u2299 yr\u207b\u00b9) or a radiatively inefficient AGN.

Overall Morphology  \n   \u2022 The dominant object is an early-type galaxy whose light distribution is smooth, centrally concentrated, and nearly circularly symmetric.  The absence of discernible spiral structure, a bar, or patchy star-forming regions places it in the elliptical class, most likely E0\u2013E1 (slightly flattened but close to round).\n\n2. Prominent Features & Characteristics  \n   a) Stellar light profile  \n      \u2022 The surface\u2013brightness profile shows a steep inner core transitioning to an extended, shallow envelope.  A de Vaucouleurs (r^1/4) law would plausibly fit the radial profile.  \n      \u2022 The outer isophotes are faint but detectable, indicating a low-surface-brightness halo that gradually blends into the sky background.\n\n   b) Nuclear properties  \n      \u2022 The innermost \u22721\u20132\u2033 is distinctly bluer (cyan/white in the RGB composite) than the surrounding halo, hinting at either (i) a weak low-ionization nuclear emission region (LINER/AGN) or (ii) a modest sprinkling of younger/intermediate-age stars.  No clear point-source PSF spike structure is visible, so if an AGN is present it is of low optical luminosity.\n\n   c) Absence of internal substructure  \n      \u2022 No bars, dust lanes, shells, boxy isophotes, or tidal plumes are apparent down to the image depth.  The light appears smooth at all radii barring minor Poisson noise.\n\n   d) Environmental companions  \n      \u2022 A small, edge-on late-type galaxy (yellow\u2013green, elongated, left of the main object) lies at a projected separation of \u224810\u2033.  Its color and flattening suggest a disk with moderate ongoing star formation.  \n      \u2022 Several red, compact sources (likely background galaxies) and a few point-like stellar objects populate the field.  None show obvious tidal distortions connecting them to the elliptical, implying no strong ongoing interaction.\n\n3. Additional Context & Interpretation  \n   \u2022 The smooth morphology and extended halo are consistent with a dynamically relaxed system in a group or cluster environment, possibly a brightest group galaxy (BGG) or a low-luminosity cD analog.  \n   \u2022 The blue nuclear tint may reflect low-level gas accretion fueling either residual star formation (<1 M\u2299 yr\u207b\u00b9) or a radiatively inefficient AGN.  High-resolution spectroscopy or UV imaging would discriminate between these scenarios.  \n   \u2022 Absent tidal features suggest any significant merger activity occurred >1 Gyr ago, allowing the stellar body to virialize.  Deeper imaging could test for ultra-low-surface-brightness shells or streams that trace earlier accretion events.  \n   \u2022 If placed at z \u2272 0.05\u20130.1, the absolute magnitude inferred from the luminosity profile would be consistent with an L* to 2 L* elliptical.

Prominent Features & Characteristics  \n   a) Central lensing galaxy  \n      \u2013 Morphology: Round to mildly elliptical, high surface-brightness core with a de-Vaucouleurs-like light profile; no obvious spiral structure or dust lanes.  \n      \u2013 Colour: Yellow\u2013green in the g-r-i composite, indicative of an old, metal-rich stellar population (consistent with an early-type lens).  \n      \u2013 Extent: Half-light radius \u22721.5\u2033; dominates the flux interior to the ring.  \n      \u2013 Possible AGN: No obvious point-source nucleus or colour excess that would flag a luminous AGN.  \n  \n   b) Einstein ring / lensed background source  \n      \u2013 Geometry: \u2248270\u2013300\u00b0 of an annulus at a mean radius of \u22482.5\u20133\u2033 from the centre; minor azimuthal brightness modulation but globally round.  \n      \u2013 Colour: The ring is overall bluish but contains at least two distinct, high-surface-brightness knots.  \n           \u2022 Knot A (ESE side; cyan/blue): Compact, unresolved at this resolution; implies a star-forming region in the background source.  \n           \u2022 Knot B (WSW side; orange/red): Slightly redder; may correspond to another region of the same galaxy with different intrinsic colour or differential magnification/extinction.  \n      \u2013 Surface-brightness profile: Relatively narrow (\u0394r \u22720.4\u2033), consistent with a lensed, distorted background galaxy rather than an extended tidal ring.  \n  \n   c) Foreground/background contaminants  \n      \u2013 No obvious foreground stars superposed on the system.  \n      \u2013 Faint point sources and low-S/N fuzz visible at larger radii are likely unrelated background galaxies.  \n  \n3. Additional Context & Interpretation  \n   \u2022 Strong-lensing scenario: The angular radius of the ring implies an Einstein radius RE \u2248 2.5\u20133\u2033; using typical velocity dispersions for an E/S0 (\u03c3 \u2248 250 km s\u207b\u00b9) places the lens at z_l ~0.2\u20130.4 and the background source at z_s \u22731, consistent with colours.  \n   \u2022 Multiple images: The colour contrast between Knot A and Knot B suggests they are multiple images of spatially separated star-forming regions in the same background galaxy being differentially magnified. Detailed lens modelling would likely recover a 4-image configuration plus the partial ring.  \n   \u2022 Alternative (ring-galaxy) hypothesis: A collisional or resonance ring could in principle produce a similar morphology, but the very clean separation between the ring and the bulge, the lack of an identifiable intruder or bar, and the pronounced colour dichotomy between ring and core favour the lensing interpretation.  \n   \u2022 Follow-up: Spectroscopy of the core and ring would decisively separate foreground and background redshifts; high-resolution imaging (e.g., HST, JWST) would constrain the lens mass distribution and reveal substructure in the source plane.\n\nClassify this galaxy by following the decision tree structure above."}, "judge_model": "gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20", "judge_thinking_budget": 24000}

Overall Morphology  \n   \u2022 The principal object is a nearly face-on, grand-design spiral galaxy.  \n   \u2022 Global Hubble-type is most consistent with SBbc/Sbc: a luminous central bulge, a possible but weak bar-like inner oval, and two dominant, well\u2013defined spiral arms with moderate pitch angle.\n\n2. Prominent Features & Characteristics  \n   a. Bulge / Nucleus  \n      \u2013 Compact, centrally concentrated, yellow\u2010white continuum indicating an evolved stellar population.  \n      \u2013 No obvious point-like AGN signature (no central saturation or diffraction spikes), but the luminosity profile is sharply peaked; a low-luminosity AGN or LINER cannot be ruled out without spectroscopy.  \n\n   b. Bar / Inner Oval  \n      \u2013 A subtle, \u223c5\u20137\u2033 elongated structure aligned roughly NNW\u2013SSE is visible inside the innermost arm winding; surface-brightness contrast is low, suggesting either a weak bar or an oval distortion rather than a strong SB bar.\n\n   c. Spiral Arms  \n      \u2013 Two main arms emerge almost diametrically from the ends of the inner oval, qualifying the system as a grand-design spiral.  \n      \u2013 Arms unwind through \u2248240\u2013270\u00b0 with an estimated pitch angle of 20\u201325\u00b0.  \n      \u2013 Blue knots and clumps along the arms trace discrete H II regions and OB associations; the clumpiness is typical of late-type spirals with ongoing star formation.  \n      \u2013 Arms remain coherent to \u22733 disk scale lengths before fading into a diffuse, low-surface-brightness outer disk.\n\n   d. Dust & Star-forming Regions  \n      \u2013 Patchy internal extinction is seen as faint, filamentary reddening on the inner edges of the arms; no large\u2010scale dust lanes cross the bulge owing to the close\u2010to\u2010face-on orientation.  \n      \u2013 Several bright, slightly resolved blue knots (notably on the E/ENE arm segment) represent compact star-forming complexes.

Overall Morphology  \n   \u2022 The principal object is a nearly face-on, grand-design spiral galaxy.  \n   \u2022 Global Hubble-type is most consistent with SBbc/Sbc: a luminous central bulge, a possible but weak bar-like inner oval, and two dominant, well\u2013defined spiral arms with moderate pitch angle.\n\n2. Prominent Features & Characteristics  \n   a. Bulge / Nucleus  \n      \u2013 Compact, centrally concentrated, yellow\u2010white continuum indicating an evolved stellar population.  \n      \u2013 No obvious point-like AGN signature (no central saturation or diffraction spikes), but the luminosity profile is sharply peaked; a low-luminosity AGN or LINER cannot be ruled out without spectroscopy.  \n\n   b. Bar / Inner Oval  \n      \u2013 A subtle, \u223c5\u20137\u2033 elongated structure aligned roughly NNW\u2013SSE is visible inside the innermost arm winding; surface-brightness contrast is low, suggesting either a weak bar or an oval distortion rather than a strong SB bar.\n\n   c. Spiral Arms  \n      \u2013 Two main arms emerge almost diametrically from the ends of the inner oval, qualifying the system as a grand-design spiral.  \n      \u2013 Arms unwind through \u2248240\u2013270\u00b0 with an estimated pitch angle of 20\u201325\u00b0.  \n      \u2013 Blue knots and clumps along the arms trace discrete H II regions and OB associations; the clumpiness is typical of late-type spirals with ongoing star formation.  \n      \u2013 Arms remain coherent to \u22733 disk scale lengths before fading into a diffuse, low-surface-brightness outer disk.\n\n   d. Dust & Star-forming Regions  \n      \u2013 Patchy internal extinction is seen as faint, filamentary reddening on the inner edges of the arms; no large\u2010scale dust lanes cross the bulge owing to the close\u2010to\u2010face-on orientation.  \n      \u2013 Several bright, slightly resolved blue knots (notably on the E/ENE arm segment) represent compact star-forming complexes. A few redder condensations (likely H II regions with strong H\u03b1+[N II] emission falling in the r band) sit on the outer arm segments.\n\n   e. Environment / Foreground & Background Objects  \n      \u2013 Multiple point sources surrounding the galaxy are present; the brighter ones have PSF profiles and colours consistent with foreground Galactic stars.  \n      \u2013 A handful of faint, red, slightly resolved background galaxies appear in the field; none show tidal distortion or obvious interaction with the primary system.  \n      \u2013 No tidal tails, shells, or asymmetries indicative of a recent major merger; the disk is dynamically undisturbed at the current image depth.\n\n3.

Overall Morphology  \n   \u2022 The central object is a nearly face-on, early-type spiral galaxy, plausibly of type SA(r)0/a\u2013Sab: a prominent bulge embedded in a smooth, low-surface-brightness disk that exhibits a faint, ring-like two\u2013arm spiral pattern.  \n   \u2022 No obvious companion is embedded in the disk, and there is no large-scale tidal distortion; the system appears dynamically relaxed.\n\n2. Prominent Features & Characteristics  \n\n   a) Bulge / Nucleus  \n      \u2013 Bright, yellow\u2013white, \u223c1\u20132\u2033 radius, roughly elliptical.  \n      \u2013 Colour implies an evolved, metal-rich stellar population; surface-brightness profile suggests a classical bulge rather than a pseudo-bulge.  \n      \u2013 Central point source is not saturated; there is no clear unresolved AGN signature (no central blue spike or diffraction pattern).\n\n   b) Disk & Spiral / Ring Structure  \n      \u2013 A diffuse, symmetrical disk extends to \u224810\u201312\u2033 diameter.  \n      \u2013 Two broad, low-contrast spiral arms wrap \u223c270\u00b0 around the bulge, joining to form an inner pseudoring.  \n      \u2013 Arms are smooth, lacking pronounced dust lanes; only a few faint, bluish star-forming knots are visible, indicating modest current star formation.  \n      \u2013 Arm pitch angle is small, consistent with an early-type spiral.\n\n   c) Bar  \n      \u2013 No clear linear bar is discernible. The inner isophotes are mildly elongated, but the elongation could be a projection of the bulge; if a bar exists it is weak and short (<3\u2033).\n\n   d) Dust & Star-forming Regions  \n      \u2013 No dark, filamentary lanes are evident.  \n      \u2013 Scattered, sub-arcsecond, blue knots along the western and southern arms mark localized H II regions; the overall star-forming intensity is low.\n\n   e) Foreground / Background Point Sources  \n      \u2013 Several foreground Galactic stars are present, identifiable by their diffraction-limited cores and colour extremes (cyan or orange).  \n      \u2013 Redder, compact objects north-east of the disk are likely background galaxies.\n\n   f) Image Artifact  \n      \u2013 A thin, \u223c4\u2033 long, green-tinted linear streak cuts the south-eastern quadrant of the disk at \u224830\u00b0 to the local radius vector.

Overall Morphology  \nThe scene is dominated by a single, moderately-inclined, disturbed disk-like system whose light is clearly bifurcated into two luminous condensations.  The absence of a well-ordered spiral pattern, together with the presence of two closely spaced brightness peaks of markedly different colour, is most consistent with an ongoing major merger between two late-type galaxies observed at a projected separation of only a few kiloparsecs.
